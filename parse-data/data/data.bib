  abstract={Objective: This study aimed to develop a comprehensive nomogram model by integrating clinical pathological and full-field digital mammography (FFDM) radiomic features to predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients, thereby providing personalized treatment recommendations. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical and imaging data of 227 breast cancer patients from 2016 to 2024 at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University. The patients were divided into a training set (n = 159) and a test set (n = 68) with a 7:3 ratio. The region of interest (ROI) was manually segmented on FFDM images, and features were extracted and gradually selected. The rad-score was calculated for each patient. Five machine learning classifiers were used to build radiomics models, and the optimal model was selected. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for predicting the efficacy of NAC in breast cancer patients. A nomogram prediction model was further developed by combining the independent risk factors and rad-score, and probability-based stratification was applied. An independent cohort was collected from an external hospital to evaluate the performance of the model. Results: The radiomics model based on support vector machine (SVM) demonstrated the best predictive performance. FFDM tumor density and HER-2 status were identified as independent risk factors for achieving pathologic complete response (PCR) after NAC (p < 0.05). The nomogram prediction model, developed by combining the independent risk factors and rad-score, outperformed other models, with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 and 0.85 for the training and test sets, respectively. Based on the optimal cutoff points of 103.42 from the nomogram model, patients were classified into high-probability and low-probability groups. When the nomogram model was applied to an independent cohort of 47 patients, only four patients had incorrect diagnoses. The nomogram model demonstrated stable and accurate predictive performance. Conclusion: The nomogram prediction model, developed by integrating clinical pathological and radiomic features, demonstrated significant performance in predicting the efficacy of NAC in breast cancer, providing valuable reference for clinical personalized prediction planning.

  abstract={Objectives: To evaluate the association between pretreatment MRI descriptors and breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials and methods: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Results: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n = 7/37, 19%), triple negative (n = 30/55, 55%), HER2 + (n = 22/37, 59%)). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p < 0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p = 0.008), higher Ki67 (p = 0.005), and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p = 0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p = 0.047), unifocality (p = 0.026), non-spiculated margins (p = 0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (p = 0.024), and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031), were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67), and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. Clinical relevance statement: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes. Key Points: • Unifocality and non-spiculated margins are independently associated with pCR at multivariable logistic regression analysis. • Breast edema score is associated with MR tumor size and TIL expression, not only in TN BC as previously reported, but also in luminal BC. • Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in machine learning classifiers significantly increased sensitivity, specificity, and precision for pCR prediction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.},

  abstract={Background: While the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is generally accepted, not all patients derive benefit from this preoperative treatment. Presently, there are no validated biomarkers to predict the NACT response, and previous attempts to develop predictive classifiers based on gene expression data have not demonstrated clinical utility. However, predictive models incorporating biological constraints have shown increased robustness and improved performance compared to agnostic classifiers. Methods: We used the preoperative transcriptomic profiles from 298 patients with TNBC to train and test a rank-based classifier, k-top scoring pairs, to predict whether the patient will have pathological complete response (pCR) or residual disease (RD) following NACT. To reduce overfitting and enhance the signature’s interpretability, we constrained the training process to genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway. Subsequently, we evaluated the signature performance on two independent cohorts with 75 and 71 patients. Finally, we assessed the prognostic value of the signature by examining its association with relapse-free survival (RFS) using Kaplan‒Meier (KM) survival estimates and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The final signature consists of five gene pairs, whose relative ordering can be predictive of the NACT response. The signature has a robust performance at predicting pCR in TNBC patients with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.76 and 0.85 in the first and second testing cohorts, respectively, outperforming other gene signatures developed for the same purpose. Additionally, the signature was significantly associated with RFS in an independent TNBC patient cohort even after adjusting for T stage, patient age at the time of diagnosis, type of breast surgery, and menopausal status. Conclusion: We introduce a robust gene signature to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with TNBC. This signature applies easily interpretable, rank-based decision rules to genes regulated by the Notch signaling pathway, a known determinant in breast cancer chemoresistance. The robust predictive and prognostic performance of the signature make it a strong candidate for clinical implementation, aiding in the stratification of TNBC patients undergoing NACT. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: The early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) will aid in the development of personalized treatments for patients with breast cancer. This study investigated the value of longitudinal multimodal deep learning (DL) based on breast MR and ultrasound (US) in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after NAC. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the pre-NAC and post-2nd-NAC MR and/or US images of 448 patients enrolled from three centers and extracted DL features from the largest section of the breast tumour using ResNet50. T test, Pearson correlation analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used to select the most significant DL features for the pre-NAC and post-2nd-NAC MR and US DL models. The stacking model integrates different single-modality DL models and meaningful clinical data. The diagnostic performance of the models was evaluated. Results: In all the patients, the pCR rate was 36.65%. There was no significant difference in diagnostic performance between the different single-modality DL models (DeLong test, p > 0.05). The stacking model integrating the above four DL models with HER2 status yielded areas under the curves of 0.951-0.979, accuracies of 91.55%–92.65%, sensitivities of 90.63%–93.94%, and specificities of 89.47%–94.44% in the cohorts. Conclusion: Longitudinal multimodal DL can be useful in predicting pCR. The stacking model can be used as a new tool for the early noninvasive prediction of the response to NAC, as evidenced by its excellent performance, and therefore aid the development of personalized treatment strategies for patients with breast cancer. © 2025 The Association of University Radiologists},

  abstract={Aim: To investigate whether methodological aspects may influence the performance of MRI-radiomic models to predict response to neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) in breast cancer (BC) patients. Materials and methods: We conducted a systematic review until March 2023. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to combine the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s test and heterogeneity was estimated by I2. A meta-regression was conducted to investigate the impact of various factors, including scanner, features’ number/transformation/type, pixel/voxel scaling, etc. Results: Forty-two studies were included. The summary AUC was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.74–0.81). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 81%) with no publication bias (p = 0.35). Radiomic model accuracy was influenced by the scanner vendor, with lower AUCs in studies using mixed scanner vendors (AUC; 95% CI: 0.70; 0.61–0.78) compared to studies including images obtained from the same scanner (AUC (95% CI): 0.83 (0.77–0.88), 0.74 (0.67–0.82), 0.83 (0.78–0.89) for three different vendors; vendors 1, 2, and 3, respectively; p-value = 0.03 for comparison with vendor 1). Feature type also seemed to have an impact on the AUC, with higher prediction accuracy observed for studies using 3D than 2D/2.5D images (AUC; 95% CI: 0.81; 0.78–0.85 and 0.73; 0.65–0.81, respectively, p-value = 0.03). Non-significant between-study heterogeneity was observed in the studies including 3D images (I2 = 33%) and Vendor 1 scanners (I2 = 40%). Conclusion: MRI-radiomics has emerged as a potential method for predicting the response to NAT in BC patients, showing promising outcomes. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the diversity among the methodological choices applied. Further investigations should prioritize achieving standardized protocols, and enhancing methodological rigor in MRI-radiomics. Key Points: Question Do methodological aspects influence the performance of MRI-radiomic models in predicting response to NAT in BC patients? Findings Radiomic model accuracy was influenced by the scanner vendor and feature type. Clinical relevance Methodological discrepancies affect the performance of MRI-radiomic models. Developing standardized protocols and enhancing methodological rigor in these studies should be prioritized. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology 2024.},

  abstract={Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is often treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST). We investigated if radiomic models based on multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) obtained early during NAST predict pathologic complete response (pCR). We included 163 patients with stage I-III TNBC with multiparametric MRI at baseline and after 2 (C2) and 4 cycles of NAST. Seventy-eight patients (48%) had pCR, and 85 (52%) had non-pCR. Thirty-six multivariate models combining radiomic features from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging had an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) > 0.7. The top-performing model combined 35 radiomic features of relative difference between C2 and baseline; had an AUC = 0.905 in the training and AUC = 0.802 in the testing set. There was high inter-reader agreement and very similar AUC values of the pCR prediction models for the 2 readers. Our data supports multiparametric MRI-based radiomic models for early prediction of NAST response in TNBC. © The Author(s) 2024.},

  abstract={Background: So far, baseline Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) has played a key role for the application of sophisticated artificial intelligence-based models using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract quantitative imaging information as earlier indicators of pathological Complete Response (pCR) achievement in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However, these models did not exploit the DCE-MRI exams in their full geometry as 3D volume but analysed only few individual slices independently, thus neglecting the depth information. Method: This study aimed to develop an explainable 3D CNN, which fulfilled the task of pCR prediction before the beginning of NAC, by leveraging the 3D information of post-contrast baseline breast DCE-MRI exams. Specifically, for each patient, the network took in input a 3D sequence containing the tumor region, which was previously automatically identified along the DCE-MRI exam. A visual explanation of the decision-making process of the network was also provided. Results: To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is competitive than other models in the field, which made use of imaging data alone, reaching a median AUC value of 81.8%, 95%CI [75.3%; 88.3%], a median accuracy value of 78.7%, 95%CI [74.8%; 82.5%], a median sensitivity value of 69.8%, 95%CI [59.6%; 79.9%] and a median specificity value of 83.3%, 95%CI [82.6%; 84.0%], respectively. The median and CIs were computed according to a 10-fold cross-validation scheme for 5 rounds. Conclusion: Finally, this proposal holds high potential to support clinicians on non-invasively early pursuing or changing patient-centric NAC pathways. © 2024 The Authors},

  abstract={Background: For patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), most of the existing prediction models of pathologic complete response (pCR) using clinicopathological features were based on standard statistical models like logistic regression, while models based on machine learning mostly utilized imaging data and/or gene expression data. This study aims to develop a robust and accessible machine learning model to predict pCR using clinicopathological features alone, which can be used to facilitate clinical decision-making in diverse settings. Methods: The model was developed and validated within the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB, 2018–2020) and an external cohort at the University of Chicago (2010–2020). We compared logistic regression and machine learning models, and examined whether incorporating quantitative clinicopathological features improved model performance. Decision curve analysis was conducted to assess the model’s clinical utility. Results: We identified 56,209 NCDB patients receiving NACT (pCR rate: 34.0%). The machine learning model incorporating quantitative clinicopathological features showed the best discrimination performance among all the fitted models [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.785, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.778–0.792], along with outstanding calibration performance. The model performed best among patients with hormone receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer (AUC: 0.817, 95% CI: 0.802–0.832); and by adopting a 7% prediction threshold, the model achieved 90.5% sensitivity and 48.8% specificity, with decision curve analysis finding a 23.1% net reduction in chemotherapy use. In the external testing set of 584 patients (pCR rate: 33.4%), the model maintained robust performance both overall (AUC: 0.711, 95% CI: 0.668–0.753) and in the HR+/HER2- subgroup (AUC: 0.810, 95% CI: 0.742–0.878). Conclusions: The study developed a machine learning model (https://huolab.cri.uchicago.edu/sample-apps/pcrmodel) to predict pCR in breast cancer patients undergoing NACT that demonstrated robust discrimination and calibration performance. The model performed particularly well among patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer, having the potential to identify patients who are less likely to achieve pCR and can consider alternative treatment strategies over chemotherapy. The model can also serve as a robust baseline model that can be integrated with smaller datasets containing additional granular features in future research. © The Author(s) 2024.},

  abstract={Background: This study aimed to assess whether a combined model incorporating radiomic and depth features extracted from PET/CT can predict disease-free survival (DFS) in patients who failed to achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Results: This study retrospectively included one hundred and five non-pCR patients. After a median follow-up of 71 months, 15 and 7 patients experienced recurrence and death, respectively. The primary tumor volume underwent feature extraction, yielding a total of 3644 radiomic features and 4096 depth features. The modeling procedure employed Cox regression for feature selection and utilized Cox proportional-hazards models to make predictions on DFS. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were utilized to evaluate and compare the predictive performance of different models. 2 clinical features (RCB, cT), 4 radiomic features, and 7 depth features were significant predictors of DFS and were included to develop models. The integrated model incorporating RCB, cT, and radiomic and depth features extracted from PET/CT images exhibited the highest accuracy for predicting 5-year DFS in the training (AUC 0.943) and the validation cohort (AUC 0.938). Conclusion: The integrated model combining radiomic and depth features extracted from PET/CT images can accurately predict 5-year DFS in non-pCR patients. It can help identify patients with a high risk of recurrence and strengthen adjuvant therapy to improve survival. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) regimens for breast cancer are generally determined according to cancer stage and molecular subtypes without fully considering the inter-patient variability, which may lead to inefficiency or overtreatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) may support personalized regimen recommendations by learning the synergistic relationship between pre-NAT individual-patient data, regimens, and corresponding short- or long-term therapy responses. Methods: In this retrospective study, we collected data from breast cancer patients treated with NAT between 2000 and 2020 from the Netherlands and the USA. Median follow-up times ranged from 3·7 to 4·9 years across molecular subtypes and cohorts. We developed and externally validated a multi-modal model integrating pre-NAT clinical data, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI images, and medical reports to predict pathological complete response (pCR) and likelihood of survival after NAT. We subsequently evaluated potential benefits for patients receiving a personalized regimen recommended based on these predictions. Findings: We trained our model on 655 patients and validated it on internal (655 patients) and external (241 patients) cohorts. Given the factual regimens, the model can correctly predict the corresponding therapy response, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0·80 (95% CI 0·73–0·87), 0·75 (0·66–0·83), and 0·85 (0·77–0·92) for pCR prediction of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+, triple-negative, and estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR)+&HER2− patients in the internal validation cohort, respectively. Performance in the external validation cohort was 0·707 (0·557–0·836), 0·558 (0·359–0·749), and 0·860 (0·767–0·945) for the corresponding molecular subtypes, respectively. In the internal validation cohort, survival prediction identified high-risk patients across different molecular subtypes, as demonstrated by a hazard ratio (HR) of 3·29 (0·91–11·94) (HER2+), 3·54 (1·52–8·20) (triple-negative), and 2·78 (1·45–5·31) (ER/PR+&HER2−), albeit results were not significant for HER2+ cancers. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that the prognostic scores generated by the response model could identify patient subgroups with relatively poor outcomes under their actual treatments. These preliminary findings may inform future efforts toward personalized NAT regimen selection beyond traditional criteria such as cancer stage and subtype, but should be interpreted cautiously and validated in prospective studies with longer follow-up because these tumors can relapse at a later stage.

  abstract={Purpose: Noninvasive, accurate and novel approaches to predict patients who will achieve pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) could assist treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to explore the application of machine learning (ML) based peritumoral ultrasound radiomics signature (PURS), compared with intratumoral radiomics (IURS) and clinicopathologic factors, for early prediction of pCR. Methods: We analyzed 358 locally advanced breast cancer patients (250 in the training set and 108 in the test set), who accepted NAC and post NAC surgery at our institution. The clinical and pathological data were analyzed using the independent t test and the Chi-square test to determine the factors associated with pCR. The PURS and IURS of baseline breast tumors were extracted by using 3D-slicer and PyRadiomics software. Five ML classifiers including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) were applied to construct radiomics predictive models. The performance of PURS, IURS models and clinicopathologic predictors were assessed with respect to sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the areas under the curve (AUCs). Results: Ninety-seven patients achieved pCR. The clinicopathologic predictors obtained an AUC of 0.759. Among PURS models, the RF classifier achieved better efficacy (AUC of 0.889) than LR (0.849), AdaBoost (0.823), SVM (0.746) and LDA (0.732). The RF classifier also obtained a maximum AUC of 0.931 than 0.920 (AdaBoost), 0.875 (LR), 0.825 (SVM), and 0.798 (LDA) in IURS models in the test set. The RF based PURS yielded higher predictive ability (AUC 0.889; 95% CI 0.814, 0.947) than clinicopathologic factors (AUC 0.759; 95% CI 0.657, 0.861; p < 0.05), but lower efficacy compared with IURS (AUC 0.931; 95% CI 0.865, 0.980; p < 0.05). Conclusion: The peritumoral US radiomics, as a novel potential biomarker, can assist clinical therapy decisions. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={Objective: This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model to accurately predict the probability of achieving total pathological complete response (tpCR) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: This multi-center retrospective study included pre-NAC clinical pathology data from 698 LABC patients. Post-operative pathological outcomes divided patients into tpCR and non-tpCR groups. Data from 586 patients at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital were randomly assigned to a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). In comparison, data from our hospital's remaining 112 patients were used for external validation. Variable selection was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis. Predictive models were constructed using six ML algorithms: decision trees, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine, light gradient boosting machine, and extreme gradient boosting. Model efficacy was assessed through various metrics, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall (PR) curves, confusion matrices, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The best-performing model was selected by comparing the performance of different algorithms. Moreover, variable relevance was ranked using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique to improve the interpretability of the model and solve the "black box" problem. Results: A total of 191 patients (32.59%) achieved tpCR following NAC. Through LASSO regression analysis, five variables were identified as predictive factors for model construction, including tumor size, Ki-67, molecular subtype, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy regimen. The KNN model outperformed the other five classifier algorithms, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.847 (95% CI: 0.809-0.883) in the training set, 0.763 (95% CI: 0.670-0.856) in the test set, and 0.665 (95% CI: 0.555-0.776) in the external validation set. DCA demonstrated that the KNN model yielded the highest net advantage through a wide range of threshold probabilities in both the training and test sets. Furthermore, the analysis of the KNN model utilizing SHAP technology demonstrated that targeted therapy is the most crucial factor in predicting tpCR. Conclusion: An ML prediction model using clinical and pathological data collected before NAC was developed and verified. This model accurately predicted the probability of achieving a tpCR in patients with LABC after receiving NAC. SHAP technology enhanced the interpretability of the model and assisted in clinical decision-making and therapy optimization. © The author(s).},

  abstract={Manual delineation of volumes of interest (VOIs) by experts is considered the gold-standard method in radiomics analysis. However, it suffers from inter- and intra-operator variability. A quantitative assessment of the impact of variations in these delineations on the performance of the radiomics predictors is required to develop robust radiomics based prediction models. In this study, we developed radiomics models for the prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with two different breast cancer subtypes based on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging acquired prior to treatment (baseline MRI scans). Different mathematical operations such as erosion, smoothing, dilation, randomization, and ellipse fitting were applied to the original VOIs delineated by experts to simulate variations of segmentation masks. The effects of such VOI modifications on various steps of the radiomics workflow, including feature extraction, feature selection, and prediction performance, were evaluated. Using manual tumor VOIs and radiomics features extracted from baseline MRI scans, an AUC of up to 0.96 and 0.89 was achieved for human epidermal growth receptor 2 positive and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively. For smoothing and erosion, VOIs yielded the highest number of robust features and the best prediction performance, while ellipse fitting and dilation lead to the lowest robustness and prediction performance for both breast cancer subtypes. At most 28% of the selected features were similar to manual VOIs when different VOI delineation data were used. Differences in VOI delineation affect different steps of radiomics analysis, and their quantification is therefore important for development of standardized radiomics research. © 2023 The Authors},

  abstract={Background: Pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has demonstrated a strong correlation to improved survival in breast cancer (BC) patients. However, pCR rates to NAC are less than 30%, depending on the BC subtype. Early prediction of NAC response would facilitate therapeutic modifications for individual patients, potentially improving overall treatment outcomes and patient survival. Purpose: This study, for the first time, proposes a hierarchical self-attention-guided deep learning framework to predict NAC response in breast cancer patients using digital histopathological images of pre-treatment biopsy specimens. Methods: Digitized hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of BC core needle biopsies were obtained from 207 patients treated with NAC, followed by surgery. The response to NAC for each patient was determined using the standard clinical and pathological criteria after surgery. The digital pathology images were processed through the proposed hierarchical framework consisting of patch-level and tumor-level processing modules followed by a patient-level response prediction component. A combination of convolutional layers and transformer self-attention blocks were utilized in the patch-level processing architecture to generate optimized feature maps. The feature maps were analyzed through two vision transformer architectures adapted for the tumor-level processing and the patient-level response prediction components. The feature map sequences for these transformer architectures were defined based on the patch positions within the tumor beds and the bed positions within the biopsy slide, respectively. A five-fold cross-validation at the patient level was applied on the training set (144 patients with 9430 annotated tumor beds and 1,559,784 patches) to train the models and optimize the hyperparameters. An unseen independent test set (63 patients with 3574 annotated tumor beds and 173,637 patches) was used to evaluate the framework. Results: The obtained results on the test set showed an AUC of 0.89 and an F1-score of 90% for predicting pCR to NAC a priori by the proposed hierarchical framework. Similar frameworks with the patch-level, patch-level + tumor-level, and patch-level + patient-level processing components resulted in AUCs of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.84 and F1-scores of 86%, 87%, and 89%, respectively. Conclusions: The results demonstrate a high potential of the proposed hierarchical deep-learning methodology for analyzing digital pathology images of pre-treatment tumor biopsies to predict the pathological response of breast cancer to NAC. © 2023 The Authors.

  abstract={Purpose: To reduce breast tumor size before surgery, Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC) is applied systematically to patients with local breast cancer. However, with the existing clinical protocols, it is not yet possible to have an early prediction of the effect of chemotherapy on a breast tumor. Predicting the response to chemotherapy could reduce toxicity and delay effec-tive treatment. Computational analysis of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Images (DCE-MRI) through Deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has proved a significant performance in classifying responders and no responder’s patients. This study intends to present a new explainable Deep Learning (DL) model predicting the breast cancer response to chemotherapy based on multiple MRI inputs. Material and Methods: In this study, a cohort of 42 breast cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy was used to train and validate the proposed DL model. This dataset was provided by the Jules Bordet institute of radiology in Brussels, Belgium. 14 external subjects were used to validate the DL model to classify responding or non-responding patients on temporal DCE-MRI volumes. The model performance was assessed by the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), accuracy, and features map visualization according to pathological complete response (Ground truth). Results: The developed deep learning architecture was able to predict the responding breast tumors to chemotherapy treatment in the external validation dataset with an AUC of 0.93 using par-allel learning MRI images acquired at different moments. The visual results showed that the most important extracted features from non-responding tumors are in the peripheral and external tumor regions. The model proposed in this study is more efficient compared to those proposed in the literature. Conclusion: Even with a limited training dataset size, the developed multi-input CNN model using DCE-MR images acquired before and following the first chemotherapy was able to predict responding and non-responding tumors with higher accuracy. Thanks to the visualization of the extracted characteristics by the DL model on the responding and non-responding tumors, the latter could be used henceforth in clinical analysis after its evaluation based on more extra data. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract={Background: Optimizing patient selection for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer remains an unmet clinical need. Quantitative features from medical imaging were reported to be predictive of treatment responses. However, the biologic meaning of these latent features is poorly understood, preventing the clinical use of such noninvasive imaging markers. The study aimed to develop a deep learning signature (DLS) from pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer and to further investigate the biologic meaning of the DLS by identifying its underlying pathways using paired MRI and proteomic sequencing data. Methods: MRI-based DLS was constructed (radiogenomic training dataset, n = 105) and validated (radiogenomic validation dataset, n = 26) for the prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Proteomic sequencing revealed biological functions facilitating pCR (n = 139). Their associations with DLS were uncovered by radiogenomic analysis. Results: The DLS achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.923 with an AUC of 0.958, higher than the performance of the model trained by transfer learning. Cellular membrane formation, endocytosis, insulin-like growth factor binding, protein localization to membranes, and cytoskeleton-dependent trafficking were differentially regulated in patients showing pCR. Oncogenic signaling pathways, features correlated with human phenotypes, and features correlated with general biological processes were significantly correlated with DLS in both training and validation dataset (p.adj < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study offers a biologically interpretable DLS for the prediction of pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer, which may guide personalized medication. © 2023 The Authors.

  abstract={Background: The pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) of breast cancer is closely related to a better prognosis. However, there are no reliable indicators to accurately identify which patients will achieve pCR before surgery, and a model for predicting pCR to NAC is required. Methods: A total of 269 breast cancer patients in Shandong Cancer Hospital and Liaocheng People’s Hospital receiving anthracycline and taxane-based NAC were prospectively enrolled. Expression profiling using a 457 cancer-related gene sequencing panel (DNA sequencing) covering genes recurrently mutated in breast cancer was carried out on 243 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies samples before NAC from 243 patients. The unique personalized panel of nine individual somatic mutation genes from the constructed model was used to detect and analyze ctDNA on 216 blood samples. Blood samples were collected at indicated time points including before chemotherapy initiation, after the 1st NAC and before the 2nd NAC cycle, during intermediate evaluation, and prior to surgery. In this study, we characterized the value of gene profile mutation and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in combination with clinical characteristics in the prediction of pCR before surgery and investigated the prognostic prediction. The median follow-up time for survival analysis was 898 days. Results: Firstly, we constructed a predictive NAC response model including five single nucleotide variant (SNV) mutations (TP53, SETBP1, PIK3CA, NOTCH4 and MSH2) and four copy number variation (CNV) mutations (FOXP1-gain, EGFR-gain, IL7R-gain, and NFKB1A-gain) in the breast tumor, combined with three clinical factors (luminal A, Her2 and Ki67 status). The tumor prediction model showed good discrimination of chemotherapy sensitivity for pCR and non-pCR with an AUC of 0.871 (95% CI, 0.797–0.927) in the training set, 0.771 (95% CI, 0.649–0.883) in the test set, and 0.726 (95% CI, 0.556–0.865) in an extra test set. This tumor prediction model can also effectively predict the prognosis of disease-free survival (DFS) with an AUC of 0.749 at 1 year and 0.830 at 3 years. We further screened the genes from the tumor prediction model to establish a unique personalized panel consisting of 9 individual somatic mutation genes to detect and analyze ctDNA. It was found that ctDNA positivity decreased with the passage of time during NAC, and ctDNA status can predict NAC response and metastasis recurrence. Finally, we constructed the chemotherapy prediction model combined with the tumor prediction model and pretreatment ctDNA levels, which has a better prediction effect of pCR with the AUC value of 0.961. Conclusions: In this study, we established a chemotherapy predictive model with a non-invasive tool that is built based on genomic features, ctDNA status, as well as clinical characteristics for predicting pCR to recognize the responders and non-responders to NAC, and also predicting prognosis for DFS in breast cancer. Adding pretreatment ctDNA levels to a model containing gene profile mutation and clinical characteristics significantly improves stratification over the clinical variables alone. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: In the ongoing battle against breast cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women globally, the urgent need for innovative prognostic markers and therapeutic targets is undeniable. This study pioneers an advanced methodology by integrating machine learning techniques to unveil a vascular mimicry signature, offering predictive insights into breast cancer outcomes. Vascular mimicry refers to the phenomenon where cancer cells mimic blood vessel formation absent of endothelial cells, a trait associated with heightened tumor aggression and diminished response to conventional treatments. Methods: The study’s comprehensive analysis spanned data from over 6,000 breast cancer patients across 12 distinct datasets, incorporating both proprietary clinical data and single-cell data from 7 patients, accounting for a total of 43,095 cells. By employing an integrative strategy that utilized 10 machine learning algorithms across 108 unique combinations, the research scrutinized 100 existing breast cancer signatures. Empirical validation was sought through immunohistochemistry assays, alongside explorations into potential immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic avenues. Results: The investigation successfully identified six genes related to vascular mimicry from multi-center cohorts, laying the groundwork for a novel predictive model. This model outstripped the prognostic accuracy of traditional clinical and molecular indicators in forecasting recurrence and mortality risks. High-risk individuals identified by our model faced worse outcomes. Further validation through IHC assays in 30 patients underscored the model’s extensive applicability. Notably, the model unveiled varying therapeutic responses; low-risk patients might achieve greater benefits from immunotherapy, whereas high-risk patients demonstrated a particular sensitivity to certain chemotherapies, such as ispinesib. Conclusions: This model marks a significant step forward in the precise evaluation of breast cancer prognosis and therapeutic responses across different patient groups. It heralds the possibility of refining patient outcomes through tailored treatment strategies, accentuating the potential of machine learning in revolutionizing cancer prognosis and management.

  abstract={Background: The accurate and early evaluation of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and minimizing unnecessary interventions. While deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise in medical imaging analysis, existing models often fail to comprehensively integrate spatial and temporal tumor dynamics. This study aims to develop and validate a spatiotemporal interaction (STI) model based on longitudinal MRI data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC in breast cancer patients. Methods: This study included retrospective and prospective datasets from five medical centers in China, collected from June 2018 to December 2024. These datasets were assigned to the primary cohort (including training and internal validation sets), external validation cohorts, and a prospective validation cohort. DCE-MRI scans from both pre-NAC (T0) and early-NAC (T1) stages were collected for each patient, along with surgical pathology results. A Siamese network-based STI model was developed, integrating spatial features from tumor segmentation with temporal dependencies using a transformer-based multi-head attention mechanism. This model was designed to simultaneously capture spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of NAC response. The STI model's performance was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Precision-Recall curve (AP), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Additionally, the I-SPY1 and I-SPY2 datasets were used for Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and to explore the biological basis of the STI model, respectively. The prospective cohort was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registration Centre (ChiCTR2500102170). Findings: A total of 1044 patients were included in this study, with the pCR rate ranging from 23.8% to 35.9%. The STI model demonstrated good performance in early prediction of NAC response in breast cancer. In the external validation cohorts, the AUC values were 0.923 (95% CI: 0.859–0.987), 0.892 (95% CI: 0.821–0.963), and 0.913 (95% CI: 0.835–0.991), all outperforming the single-timepoint T0 or T1 models, as well as models with spatial information added (all p < 0.05, Delong test). Additionally, the STI model significantly outperformed the clinical model (p < 0.05, Delong test) and radiologists’ predictions. In the prospective validation cohort, the STI model identified 90.2% (37/41) of non-pCR and 82.6% (19/23) of pCR patients, reducing misclassification rates by 58.7% and 63.3% compared to radiologists. This indicates that these patients might benefit from treatment adjustment or continued therapy in the early NAC stage. Survival analysis showed a significant correlation between the STI model and both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients. Further investigation revealed that favorable NAC responses predicted by the STI model were closely linked to upregulated immune-related genes and enhanced immune cell infiltration. Interpretation: Our study established a novel noninvasive STI model that integrates the spatiotemporal evolution of MRI before and during NAC to achieve early and accurate pCR prediction, offering potential guidance for personalized treatment.

  abstract={Background Breast cancer (BC) continues to pose a substantial global health concern, necessitating continuous advancements in therapeutic approaches. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has gained prominence as a key therapeutic strategy, and there is growing interest in the predictive utility of Background Parenchymal Enhancement (BPE) in evaluating the response of breast tumors to NAC. However, the analysis of BPE as a predictive bio-marker, along with the techniques used to model BPE changes for accurate and timely predictions of treatment response presents several obstacles. This systematic review aims to thoroughly investigate recent advancements in the analytical methodologies for BPE analysis, and to evaluate their reliability and effectiveness in predicting breast tumor response to NAC, ultimately contributing to the development of personalized and effective therapeutic strategies. Methods A comprehensive and structured literature search was conducted across key electronic databases, including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore covering articles published up to May 10, 2024. The inclusion criteria targeted studies focusing on breast cancer cohorts treated with NAC, involving both pre-treatment and at least one post-treatment breast dynamic contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) scan, and analyzing BPE utility in predicting breast tumor response to NAC. Methodological quality assessment and data extraction were performed to synthesize findings and identify commonalities and differences among various BPE analytical approaches. Results The search yielded a total of 882 records. After meticulous screening, 78 eligible records were identified, with 13 studies ultimately meeting the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Analysis of the literature revealed a significant evolution in BPE analysis, from early studies focusing on single time-point BPE analysis to more recent studies adopting longitudinal BPE analysis. The review uncovered several gaps that compromise the accuracy and timeliness of existing longitudinal BPE analysis methods, such as missing data across multiple imaging time points, manual segmentation of the whole-breast region of interest, and over reliance on traditional statistical methods like logistic regression for modeling BPE and pathological complete response (pCR). Conclusion This review provides a thorough examination of current advancements in analytical approaches for BPE analysis in predicting breast tumor response to NAC. The shift towards longitudinal BPE analysis has highlighted significant gaps, suggesting the need for alternative analytical techniques, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Future longitudinal BPE research work should focus on standardization in longitudinal BPE measurement and analysis, through integration of deep learning-based approaches for automated tumor segmentation, and implementation of advanced AI technique that can better accommodate varied breast tumor responses, non-linear relationships and complex temporal dynamics in BPE datasets, while also handling missing data more effectively. Such integration could lead to more precise and timely predictions of breast tumor responses to NAC, thereby enhancing personalized and effective breast cancer treatment strategies. © 2025 Thomas et al.

  abstract={Introduction: This study evaluated the performance of primary foci of breast cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contributing to establish and validate radiomics-based nomograms for predicting the different pathological outcome of breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials and Methods: Retrospectively collected 387 patients with locally advanced breast cancer, all treated with NAC and received breast dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) before NAC. Radiomics signatures were extracted from region of interest (ROI) on multiparametric MRI to build rad score. Clinical-pathologic data and radiological features established the clinical model. The comprehensive model featured rad-score, predictive clinical-pathologic data and radiological features, which was ultimately displayed as a nomogram. Patients were grouped in 2 different ways in accordance with the Miller-Payne (MP) grading of surgical specimens. The first grouping method: 181 patients with pathological reaction grades Ⅳ∼Ⅴ were included in the significant remission group, while 206 patients with pathological reaction grades Ⅰ∼Ⅲ were included in the nonsignificant remission group. The second grouping method: 117 patients with pathological complete response (pCR) were assigned to the pCR group, and 270 patients who failed to meet pCR were assigned to in the non-pCR group. Two combined nomograms are created from 2 grouped data for predicting different pathological responses to NAC. The area under the curves (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were used to evaluate the performance of each model. While decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves were used for estimating the clinical application value of the nomogram. Results: Two combined nomograms embodying rad score and clinical-pathologic data outperformed, showing good calibrations for predicting response to NAC. The combined nomogram predicting pCR showed the best performance with the AUC values of 0.97, 0.90 and 0.86 in the training, testing, and external validation cohorts respectively. The AUC values of another combined nomogram predicting significant remission: 0.98, 0.88 0.80 in the training, testing and external validation cohorts. DCA showed the comprehensive model nomogram obtained the most clinical benefit. Conclusions: The combined nomogram could preoperatively predict significant remission or even pCR to NAC in breast cancer based on multiparametric MRI and clinical-pathologic data. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can downstage tumors and axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer (BC) patients. However, tumors and axillary response to NAC are not parallel and vary among patients. This study aims to explore the feasibility of deep learning radiomics nomogram (DLRN) for independently predicting the status of tumors and lymph node metastasis (LNM) after NAC. Methods: In total, 484 BC patients who completed NAC from two hospitals (H1: 297 patients in the training cohort and 99 patients in the validation cohort; H2: 88 patients in the test cohort) were retrospectively enrolled. The authors developed two deep learning radiomics (DLR) models for personalized prediction of the tumor pathologic complete response (PCR) to NAC (DLR-PCR) and the LNM status (DLR-LNM) after NAC based on pre-NAC and after-NAC ultrasonography images. Furthermore, they proposed two DLRNs (DLRN-PCR and DLRN-LNM) for two different tasks based on the clinical characteristics and DLR scores, which were generated from both DLR-PCR and DLR-LNM. Results: In the validation and test cohorts, DLRN-PCR exhibited areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.903 and 0.896 with sensitivities of 91.2% and 75.0%, respectively. DLRN-LNM achieved AUCs of 0.853 and 0.863, specificities of 82.0% and 81.8%, and negative predictive values of 81.3% and 87.2% in the validation and test cohorts, respectively. The two DLRN models achieved satisfactory predictive performance based on different BC subtypes. Conclusions: The proposed DLRN models have the potential to accurately predict the tumor PCR and LNM status after NAC. Plain language summary: In this study, we proposed two deep learning radiomics nomogram models based on pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and preoperative ultrasonography images for independently predicting the status of tumor and axillary lymph node (ALN) after NAC. A more comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition after NAC can be achieved by predicting the status of the tumor and ALN separately. Our model can potentially provide a noninvasive and personalized method to offer decision support for organ preservation and avoidance of excessive surgery. © 2022 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract={Background: This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning models to predict pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer patients. Methods: Clinical and pathological data from 1143 patients were analyzed, encompassing variables such as age, gender, marital status, histologic grade, T stage, N stage, months from diagnosis to treatment, molecular subtype, and response to neoadjuvant therapy. Seven machine learning models were trained and validated using both internal and external datasets. Model performance was evaluated using multiple metrics, and interpretability analysis was conducted to assess feature importance. Results: Key variables influencing pCR included grade, N stage, months from diagnosis to treatment, and molecular subtype. The Naive Bayes model emerged as the most effective, with accuracy (0.746), sensitivity (0.699), specificity (0.808), and F1 score (0.759) surpassing other models. Both internal and external validation confirmed the model’s robust predictive power. A web tool was developed for clinical use, aiding in personalized treatment planning. Interpretability analysis further elucidated the contribution of features to pCR prediction, enhancing clinical applicability. Conclusion: The Naive Bayes model provides a robust tool for personalized treatment decisions in patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. By accurately predicting pCR rates, it enables clinicians to tailor treatment strategies, potentially improving outcomes. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={We trained and validated a deep learning model that can predict the treatment response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) for patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the pre-treatment (baseline) and after four cycles (C4) of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide treatment were used as inputs to the model for prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR). Based on the standard pCR definition that includes disease status in either breast or axilla, the model achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.96 ± 0.05, 0.78 ± 0.09, 0.88 ± 0.02, and 0.76 ± 0.03, for the training, validation, testing, and prospective testing groups, respectively. For the pCR status of breast only, the retrained model achieved prediction AUCs of 0.97 ± 0.04, 0.82 ± 0.10, 0.86 ± 0.03, and 0.83 ± 0.02, for the training, validation, testing, and prospective testing groups, respectively. Thus, the developed deep learning model is highly promising for predicting the treatment response to NAST of TNBC.Clinical Relevance-Deep learning based on serial and multiparametric MRIs can potentially distinguish TNBC patients with pCR from non-pCR at the early stage of neoadjuvant systemic therapy, potentially enabling more personalized treatment of TNBC patients. © 2023 IEEE.},

  abstract={Introduction: Breast cancers are complex ecosystem like networks of malignant cells and their associated microenvironment. Applications for machine intelligence and the tumoral microenvironment are expanding frontiers in pathology. Previously, computational approaches have been developed to quantify and spatially analyze immune cells, proportionate stroma, and detect tumor budding. Little work has been done to analyze different types of tumor-associated stromata both quantitatively and computationally in relation to clinical endpoints. Methods: We aimed to quantify stromal features from whole slide images (WSI) including stromata (myxoid, collagenous, immune) and tumoral components and combined them with traditional clinical and pathologic parameters in 120 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and poor clinical outcomes. Results: High collagenous stroma on WSI was best associated with lower rates of pCR, while combined high proportionated stroma (myxoid, collagenous, and immune) most optimally predicted worse clinical survival outcomes. When combining clinical, pathologic, and WSI features, Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) curves for LASSO features was up to 0.67 for pCR and 0.77 for poor outcomes. Conclusion: The techniques demonstrated in the present study can be performed with appropriate quality assurance. Future trials are needed to demonstrate whether coupling applications for machine intelligence, inclusive of the tumor mesenchyme, can improve outcomes prediction for patients with breast cancer. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

  abstract={Purpose: To describe the design, conduct, and results of the Breast Multiparametric MRI for prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Response (BMMR2) challenge. Materials and Methods: The BMMR2 computational challenge opened on May 28, 2021, and closed on December 21, 2021. The goal of the challenge was to identify image-based markers derived from multiparametric breast MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, along with clinical data for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant treatment. Data included 573 breast MRI studies from 191 women (mean age [±SD], 48.9 years ± 10.56) in the I-SPY 2/American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) 6698 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01042379). The challenge cohort was split into training (60%) and test (40%) sets, with teams blinded to test set pCR outcomes. Prediction performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with the benchmark established from the ACRIN 6698 primary analysis. Results: Eight teams submitted final predictions. Entries from three teams had point estimators of AUC that were higher than the benchmark performance (AUC, 0.782 [95% CI: 0.670, 0.893], with AUCs of 0.803 [95% CI: 0.702, 0.904], 0.838 [95% CI: 0.748, 0.928], and 0.840 [95% CI: 0.748, 0.932]). A variety of approaches were used, ranging from extraction of individual features to deep learning and artificial intelligence methods, incorporating DCE and DWI alone or in combination. Conclusion: The BMMR2 challenge identified several models with high predictive performance, which may further expand the value of multiparametric breast MRI as an early marker of treatment response.

  abstract={Predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients is a critical clinical endeavor, as it provides insights into individual patient responses and potential treatment outcomes. Despite the wealth of information available from MRI techniques such as DCE-MRI, pMRI, and SER, gleaning actionable insights from such complex data remains a challenging feat due to inherent variations in tumor biology, size, location, and blood flow patterns. Addressing this challenge, our study introduces the Multi-modal Cross Attention Network (MMCA), a novel deep learning approach designed to synergistically harness and emphasize the complementary information present across different MRI modalities. MMCA leverages an attention mechanism to adeptly weigh and integrate critical features, ensuring a more comprehensive and accurate pCR prediction. Comparative experiments against conventional deep learning architectures, including ResNet and DenseNet, showcased the prowess of MMCA. Specifically, through a 5-fold cross-validation, MMCA achieved an accuracy of 0.797 and an AUC of 0.758, outperforming other methods. This research not only demonstrates the potential of advanced deep learning algorithms combined with multimodal fusion techniques, but also sets a new benchmark for non-invasive pCR prediction using complex MRI data.  © 2023 IEEE.},

  abstract={Background: The biological phenotype of tumours evolves during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Accurate prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC in the early-stage or posttreatment can optimize treatment strategies or improve the breast-conserving rate. This study aimed to develop and validate an autosegmentation-based serial ultrasonography assessment system (SUAS) that incorporated serial ultrasonographic features throughout the NAC of breast cancer to predict pCR. Methods: A total of 801 patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer were retrospectively enrolled from three institutions and were split into a training cohort (242 patients), an internal validation cohort (197 patients), and two external test cohorts (212 and 150 patients). Three imaging signatures were constructed from the serial ultrasonographic features before (pretreatment signature), during the first–second cycle of (early-stage treatment signature), and after (posttreatment signature) NAC based on autosegmentation by U-net. The SUAS was constructed by subsequently integrating the pre, early-stage, and posttreatment signatures, and the incremental performance was analysed. Results: The SUAS yielded a favourable performance in predicting pCR, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.927 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.891–0.963] and 0.914 (95% CI 0.853–0.976), compared with those of the clinicopathological prediction model [0.734 (95% CI 0.665–0.804) and 0.610 (95% CI 0.504–0.716)], and radiologist interpretation [0.632 (95% CI 0.570–0.693) and 0.724 (95% CI 0.644–0.804)] in the external test cohorts. Furthermore, similar results were also observed in the early-stage treatment of NAC [AUC 0.874 (0.793–0.955)–0.897 (0.851–0.943) in the external test cohorts]. Conclusions: We demonstrate that autosegmentation-based SAUS integrating serial ultrasonographic features throughout NAC can predict pCR with favourable performance, which can facilitate individualized treatment strategies. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Objectives: Response assessment to neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAST) to guide individualized treatment in breast cancer is a clinical research priority. We aimed to develop an intelligent algorithm using multi-modal pretreatment ultrasound and tomosynthesis radiomics features in addition to clinical variables to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) prior to the initiation of therapy. Methods: We used retrospective data on patients who underwent ultrasound and tomosynthesis before starting NAST. We developed a support vector machine algorithm using pretreatment ultrasound and tomosynthesis radiomics features in addition to patient and tumor variables to predict pCR status (ypT0 and ypN0). Findings were compared to the histopathologic evaluation of the surgical specimen. The main outcome measures were area under the curve (AUC) and false-negative rate (FNR). Results: We included 720 patients, 504 in the development set and 216 in the validation set. Median age was 51.6 years and 33.6% (242 of 720) achieved pCR. The addition of radiomics features significantly improved the performance of the algorithm (AUC 0.72 to 0.81; p = 0.007). The FNR of the multi-modal radiomics and clinical algorithm was 6.7% (10 of 150 with missed residual cancer). Surface/volume ratio at tomosynthesis and peritumoral entropy characteristics at ultrasound were the most relevant radiomics. Hormonal receptors and HER-2 status were the most important clinical predictors. Conclusion: A multi-modal machine learning algorithm with pretreatment clinical, ultrasound, and tomosynthesis radiomics features may aid in predicting residual cancer after NAST. Pending prospective validation, this may facilitate individually tailored NAST regimens. Clinical relevance statement: Multi-modal radiomics using pretreatment ultrasound and tomosynthesis showed significant improvement in assessing response to NAST compared to an algorithm using clinical variables only. Further prospective validation of our findings seems warranted to enable individualized predictions of NAST outcomes. Key Points: • We proposed a multi-modal machine learning algorithm with pretreatment clinical, ultrasound, and tomosynthesis radiomics features to predict response to neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment. • Compared with the clinical algorithm, the AUC of this integrative algorithm is significantly higher. • Used prior to the initiative of therapy, our algorithm can identify patients who will experience pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant therapy with a high negative predictive value. © The Author(s) 2023.},

  abstract={Patient selection for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer remains an unmet clinical need. While quantitative features from medical imaging have been reported to predict treatment responses, the biological meaning of these features is not well understood, which hinders their clinical use.

The DLS achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.923 with an AUC of 0.957. Pathways including mitochondrial energy metabolism, vesicle budding and vascular transportation, protein localization to membranes, mRNA processing, and cytoskeleton-dependent trafficking were differentially regulated in patients showing pCR and were significantly correlated with DLS in the validation dataset. This study offers a biologically interpretable DLS for predicting pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, which may guide personalized medication.  © 2023 IEEE.},

  abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning-based radiomic (DLR) model combined with clinical characteristics for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. For early prediction of pCR, the DLR model was based on pre-treatment and early treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 95 women (mean age, 48.1 years; range, 29–77 years) who underwent DCE-MRI before (pre-treatment) and after two or three cycles of NAC (early treatment) from 2018 to 2021. The patients in this study were randomly divided into a training cohort (n=67) and a validation cohort (n=28) at a ratio of 7:3. Deep learning and handcrafted features were extracted from pre- and early treatment DCE-MRI contoured lesions. These features contribute to the construction of radiomic signature RS1 and RS2 representing information from different periods. Mutual information and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used for feature selection. A combined model was then developed based on the DCE-MRI features and clinical characteristics. The performance of the models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared using the DeLong test. Results: The overall pCR rate was 25.3% (24/95). One radiomic feature and three deep learning features in RS1, five radiomic features and 11 deep learning features in RS2, and five clinical characteristics remained in the feature selection. The performance of the DLR model combining pre- and early treatment information (AUC=0.900) was better than that of RS1 (AUC=0.644, P=0.068) and slightly higher that of RS2 (AUC=0.888, P=0.604) in the validation cohort. The combined model including pre- and early treatment information and clinical characteristics showed the best ability with an AUC of 0.925 in the validation cohort. Conclusion: The combined model integrating pre-treatment, early treatment DCE-MRI data, and clinical characteristics showed good performance in predicting pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer. Early treatment DCE-MRI and clinical characteristics may play an important role in evaluating the outcomes of NAC by predicting pCR.

  abstract={Background: Radiomics research based on whole tumors is limited by the unclear biological significance of radiomics features, which therefore lack clinical interpretability. Purpose: We aimed to determine whether features extracted from subregions defined by habitat imaging, reflecting tumor heterogeneity, could identify breast cancer patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), to optimize treatment. Methods: 143 women with stage II–III breast cancer were divided into a training set (100 patients, 36 with pathologic complete response [pCR]) and a test set (43 patients, 16 with pCR). Patients underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before NAC. With the pathological results as the gold standard, we used the training set to build models for predicting pCR based on whole-tumor radiomics (ModelWH), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-based habitat imaging (ModelHabitats), conventional MRI features (ModelCF), and immunohistochemical findings (ModelIHC). We also built the combined models ModelHabitats+CF and ModelHabitats+CF+IHC. In the test set, we compared the performance of the combined models with that of the invasive ModelIHC by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive value of the model. The DeLong test was used to compare diagnostic efficiency across different parameters. Results: In the prediction of pCR, ModelWH, ModelHabitats, ModelCF, ModelIHC, ModelHabitats+CF, ModelCF+IHC and ModelHabitats+CF+IHC achieved AUCs of 0.895, 0.757, 0.705, 0.807, 0.800, 0.856, and 0.891 respectively, in the training set and 0.549, 0.708, 0.700, 0.788, 0.745, 0.909, and 0.891 respectively, in the test set. The DeLong test revealed no significant difference between ModelIHC versus ModelHabitats+CF (p = 0.695) and ModelHabitats+CF+IHC versus ModelCF+IHC (p = 0.382) but showed a significant difference between ModelIHC and ModelHabitats+CF+IHC (p = 0.043). Conclusion: The habitat model we established from first-order features combined with conventional MRI features and IHC findings accurately predicted pCR before NAC. This model can facilitate decision-making during individualized treatment for breast cancer. © 2025 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

  abstract={Early prediction of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) response for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients could help oncologists select individualized treatment and avoid toxic effects associated with ineffective therapy in patients unlikely to achieve pathologic complete response (pCR). The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of radiomic features of the peritumoral and tumoral regions from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) acquired at different time points of NAST for early treatment response prediction in TNBC. This study included 163 Stage I-III patients with TNBC undergoing NAST as part of a prospective clinical trial (NCT02276443). Peritumoral and tumoral regions of interest were segmented on DCE images at baseline (BL) and after two (C2) and four (C4) cycles of NAST. Ten first-order (FO) radiomic features and 300 gray-level-co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features were calculated. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to determine the most predictive features. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for performance assessment. Pearson correlation was used to assess intrareader and interreader variability. Seventy-eight patients (48%) had pCR (52 training, 26 testing), and 85 (52%) had non-pCR (57 training, 28 testing). Forty-six radiomic features had AUC at least 0.70, and 13 multivariate models had AUC at least 0.75 for training and testing sets. The Pearson correlation showed significant correlation between readers. In conclusion, Radiomic features from DCE-MRI are useful for differentiating pCR and non-pCR. Similarly, predictive radiomic models based on these features can improve early noninvasive treatment response prediction in TNBC patients undergoing NAST.

  abstract={Background: About 15%–20% of breast cancer (BC) cases is classified as Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor type 2 (HER2) positive. The Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was initially introduced for locally advanced and inflammatory BC patients to allow a less extensive surgical resection, whereas now it represents the current standard for early-stage and operable BC. However, only 20%–40% of patients achieve pathologic complete response (pCR). According to the results of practice-changing clinical trials, the addition of trastuzumab to NAC brings improvements to pCR, and recently, the use of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab has registered further statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in terms of pCR. The goal of our work is to propose a machine learning model to predict the pCR to NAC in HER2-positive patients based on a subset of clinical features. Method: First, we evaluated the significant association of clinical features with pCR on the retrospectively collected data referred to 67 patients afferent to Istituto Tumori “Giovanni Paolo II.” Then, we performed a feature selection procedure to identify a subset of features to be used for training a machine learning-based classification algorithm. As a result, pCR to NAC was associated with ER status, Pgr status, and HER2 score. Results: The machine learning model trained on a subgroup of essential features reached an AUC of 73.27% (72.44%–73.66%) and an accuracy of 71.67% (71.64%–73.13%). According to our results, the clinical features alone are not enough to define a support system useful for clinical pathway. Conclusion: Our results seem worthy of further investigation in large validation studies and this work could be the basis of future study that will also involve radiomics analysis of biomedical images. © 2023 The Authors.

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: To propose a novel MRI-based hyper-fused radiomic approach to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer (BC). Materials and Methods: Pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and ultra-multi-b-value (UMB) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were acquired in BC patients who received NAT followed by surgery at two centers. Hyper-fused radiomic features (RFs) and conventional RFs were extracted from DCE-MRI or UMB-DWI. After feature selection, the following models were built using logistic regression and the retained RFs: hyper-fused model, conventional model, and compound model that integrates the hyper-fused and conventional RFs. The output probability of each model was used to generate a radiomic signature. The model's performance was quantified by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify variables (clinicopathological variables and the generated radiomic signatures) associated with pCR. Results: The training/external test set (center 1/2) included 547/295 women. The hyper-fused models (AUCs=0.81–0.85) outperformed (p<0.05) the conventional models (AUCs=0.74–0.80) in predicting pCR. The compound models (AUCs=0.88–0.93) outperformed (p<0.05) the hyper-fused models and conventional models for pCR prediction. The hyper-fused radiomic signatures (odds ratios=5.70–12.98; p<0.05) and compound radiomic signatures (odds ratios=1.57–7.71; p<0.05) were independently associated with pCR. These are true for the training and external test sets. Conclusion: The hyper-fused radiomic approach had significantly better performance for predicting pCR to NAT than the conventional radiomic approach, and the hyper-fused RFs provided incremental discrimination of pCR beyond the conventional RFs. The generated hyper-fused radiomic signatures were independent predictors of pCR. © 2025 The Association of University Radiologists},

  abstract={Background: Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) has substantially improved pathologic complete response (pCR) rates in early triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the predictive accuracy of posttreatment MRI remains unexplored. Purpose: To assess the performance of posttreatment MRI in the prediction of pCR in participants with TNBC treated with NACI. Materials and Methods: In this prospective multicenter study (August 2021–June 2024), women with early TNBC were recruited from three centers (training set: Institut Curie; test set: Institut Godinot and Institut Oscar Lambret). Post-NACI dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans from multiple vendors were analyzed. Radiologic complete response (rCR)—defined as no enhancement in the tumor bed—was evaluated for predicting pCR. A multivariable logistic regression model incorporating rCR, nodal involvement, and Ki-67 index was developed and externally validated. In cases with residual enhancement (non-rCR), a radiomic score using shape and first-order features was tested. Results: A total of 175 women were included in the training set (mean age, 49 years ± 11 [SD]) and 84 women in the external test set (mean age, 52 years ± 12). The rCR at MRI was predictive of pCR, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.92). The combined model (rCR + nodal status + Ki-67) yielded an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.96) in the test set. In node-negative patients with Ki-67 greater than 30%, the rCR false-discovery rate (ie, the proportion of rCR cases that were actually non-pCR or residual disease missed at breast MRI) was 3.6% (two of 56) in the training set and 3.5% (one of 29) in the test set; all cancers were limited to residual cancer burden I. In non-rCR cases, a model incorporating the radiomics score and lesion count achieved an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.90). Conclusion: Posttreatment rCR at MRI demonstrated strong predictive value for pCR in early TNBC following NACI. © RSNA, 2025.},

  abstract={Objective: Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has been widely implemented as an essential treatment to improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with locally-advanced cancer to reduce tumor burden and prolong survival, particularly for human epidermal growth receptor 2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer. The role of peripheral immune components in predicting therapeutic responses has received limited attention. Herein we determined the relationship between dynamic changes in peripheral immune indices and therapeutic responses during NAT administration. Methods: Peripheral immune index data were collected from 134 patients before and after NAT. Logistic regression and machine learning algorithms were applied to the feature selection and model construction processes, respectively. Results: Peripheral immune status with a greater number of CD3+ T cells before and after NAT, and a greater number of CD8+ T cells, fewer CD4+ T cells, and fewer NK cells after NAT was significantly related to a pathological complete response (P < 0.05). The post-NAT NK cell-to-pre-NAT NK cell ratio was negatively correlated with the response to NAT (HR = 0.13, P = 0.008). Based on the results of logistic regression, 14 reliable features (P < 0.05) were selected to construct the machine learning model. The random forest model exhibited the best power to predict efficacy of NAT among 10 machine learning model approaches (AUC = 0.733). Conclusions: Statistically significant relationships between several specific immune indices and the efficacy of NAT were revealed. A random forest model based on dynamic changes in peripheral immune indices showed robust performance in predicting NAT efficacy. ©2023 Cancer Biology & Medicine.

  abstract={Background: Previous deep learning models have been proposed to predict the pathological complete response (pCR) and axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in breast cancer. Yet, the models often leveraged multiple frameworks, required manual annotation, and discarded low-quality images. We aimed to develop an automated and reusable deep learning (AutoRDL) framework for tumor detection and prediction of pCR and ALNM using ultrasound images with diverse qualities. Methods: The AutoRDL framework includes a You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) network for tumor detection and a progressive multi-granularity (PMG) network for pCR and ALNM prediction. The training cohort and the internal validation cohort were recruited from Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital (GPPH) between November 2012 and May 2021. The two external validation cohorts were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University (KMUH), between January 2016 and December 2019, and Shunde Hospital of Southern Medical University (SHSMU) between January 2014 and July 2015. Prior to model training, super-resolution via iterative refinement (SR3) was employed to improve the spatial resolution of low-quality images from the KMUH. We developed three models for predicting pCR and ALNM: a clinical model using multivariable logistic regression analysis, an image model utilizing the PMG network, and a combined model that integrates both clinical and image data using the PMG network. Findings: The YOLOv5 network demonstrated excellent accuracy in tumor detection, achieving average precisions of 0.880–0.921 during validation. In terms of pCR prediction, the combined modelpost-SR3 outperformed the combined modelpre-SR3, image modelpost-SR3, image modelpre-SR3, and clinical model (AUC: 0.833 vs 0.822 vs 0.806 vs 0.790 vs 0.712, all p < 0.05) in the external validation cohort (KMUH). Consistently, the combined modelpost-SR3 exhibited the highest accuracy in ALNM prediction, surpassing the combined modelpre-SR3, image modelpost-SR3, image modelpre-SR3, and clinical model (AUC: 0.825 vs 0.806 vs 0.802 vs 0.787 vs 0.703, all p < 0.05) in the external validation cohort 1 (KMUH). In the external validation cohort 2 (SHSMU), the combined model also showed superiority over the clinical and image models (0.819 vs 0.712 vs 0.806, both p < 0.05). Interpretation: Our proposed AutoRDL framework is feasible in automatically predicting pCR and ALNM in real-world settings, which has the potential to assist clinicians in optimizing individualized treatment options for patients.

  abstract={Background: Morphological and vascular characteristics of breast cancer can change during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)-acquired pre- and mid-treatment quantitatively capture information about tumor heterogeneity as potential earlier indicators of pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC in breast cancer. Aims: This study aimed to develop an ensemble deep learning-based model, exploiting a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which merges features automatically extracted from five segmented slices of both pre- and mid-treatment exams containing the maximum tumor area, to predict and monitor pCR to NAC. Materials and Methods: Imaging data analyzed in this study referred to a cohort of 86 breast cancer patients, randomly split into training and test sets at a ratio of 8:2, who underwent NAC and for which information regarding the pCR status was available (37.2% of patients achieved pCR). We further validated our model using a subset of 20 patients selected from the publicly available I-SPY2 trial dataset (independent test). Results: The performances of the proposed model were assessed using standard evaluation metrics, and promising results were achieved: area under the curve (AUC) value of 91.4%, accuracy value of 82.4%, a specificity value of 80.0%, a sensitivity value of 85.7%, precision value of 75.0%, F-score value of 80.0%, and G-mean value of 82.8%. The results obtained from the independent test show an AUC of 81.3%, an accuracy of 80.0%, a specificity value of 76.9%, a sensitivity of 85.0%, a precision of 66.7%, an F-score of 75.0%, and a G-mean of 81.2%. Discussion: As far as we know, our research is the first proposal using ViTs on DCE-MRI exams to monitor pCR over time during NAC. Conclusion: Finally, the changes in DCE-MRI at pre- and mid-treatment could affect the accuracy of pCR prediction to NAC. © 2024 The Author(s). Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

  abstract={Background: Generalizability of predictive models for pathological complete response (pCR) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients requires diverse datasets. This study employed four machine learning models to predict pCR and OS up to 7.5 years using data from a diverse and underserved inner-city population. Methods: Demographics, staging, tumor subtypes, income, insurance status, and data from radiology reports were obtained from 475 breast cancer patients on neoadjuvant chemotherapy in an inner-city health system (01/01/2012 to 12/31/2021). Logistic regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Regression models were used to predict outcomes (pCR and OS) with fivefold cross validation. Results: pCR was not associated with age, race, ethnicity, tumor staging, Nottingham grade, income, and insurance status (p > 0.05). ER−/HER2+ showed the highest pCR rate, followed by triple negative, ER+/HER2+, and ER+/HER2− (all p < 0.05), tumor size (p < 0.003) and background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) (p < 0.01). Machine learning models ranked ER+/HER2−, ER−/HER2+, tumor size, and BPE as top predictors of pCR (AUC = 0.74–0.76). OS was associated with race, pCR status, tumor subtype, and insurance status (p < 0.05), but not ethnicity and incomes (p > 0.05). Machine learning models ranked tumor stage, pCR, nodal stage, and triple-negative subtype as top predictors of OS (AUC = 0.83–0.85). When grouping race and ethnicity by tumor subtypes, neither OS nor pCR were different due to race and ethnicity for each tumor subtype (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Tumor subtypes and imaging characteristics were top predictors of pCR in our inner-city population. Insurance status, race, tumor subtypes and pCR were associated with OS. Machine learning models accurately predicted pCR and OS. © 2024, The Author(s).},

  abstract={HER2+ breast cancer (BC) is an aggressive subtype genetically and biologically heterogeneous. We evaluate the predictive and prognostic role of HER2 protein/gene expression levels combined with clinico-pathologic features in 154 HER2+ BCs patients who received trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The tumoral pathological complete response (pCR) rate was 40.9%. High tumoral pCR show a scarce mortality rate vs subjects with a lower response. 93.7% of ypT0 were HER2 IHC3+ BC, 6.3% were HER2 IHC 2+/SISH+ and 86.7% of ypN0 were HER2 IHC3+, the remaining were HER2 IHC2+/SISH+. Better pCR rate correlate with a high percentage of infiltrating immune cells and right-sided tumors, that reduce distant metastasis and improve survival, but no incidence difference. HER2 IHC score and laterality emerge as strong predictors of tumoral pCR after NACT from machine learning analysis. HER2 IHC3+ and G3 are poor prognostic factors for HER2+ BC patients, and could be considered in the application of neoadjuvant therapy. Increasing TILs concentrations, lower lymph node ratio and lower residual tumor cellularity are associated with a better outcome. The immune microenvironment and scarce lymph node involvement have crucial role in clinical outcomes. The combination of all predictors might offer new options for NACT effectiveness prediction and stratification of HER2+ BC during clinical decision-making. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

  abstract={Background: Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) in breast cancer contributes to treatment failure and relapse. Noninvasive methods to quantify ITH are currently limited. Purpose: To quantify ITH in breast cancer using pretreatment MRI, develop a nomogram to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), and investigate biologic pathways associated with nomogram scores. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included patients with breast cancer who underwent NAC at nine centers between April 1988 and December 2023. Tumor regions on MRI scans were clustered and integrated with global pixel distribution patterns to calculate ITH scores. A nomogram for predicting pCR was developed using multivariable logistic regression. A survival dataset was used to evaluate the association between nomogram score and RFS, and a genomics dataset was used to explore the relationship between nomogram score and biologic pathways. Results: The study included 1448 women (median age, 49 years [IQR, 43–54 years]). To predict pCR to NAC, the 505 patients from center A served as the training set, and the patients from center B, centers C–F, and center G served as three external validation sets (n = 331, 107, and 384, respectively). The survival set included patients from centers A and H (n = 179), and the genomics set included patients from center I (n = 74). The ITH score was an independent predictor of pCR (odds ratio, 0.12 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.43]; P < .001). The nomogram model achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.82, 0.81, and 0.79, respectively, in the three external validation sets. A lower nomogram score was correlated with poorer RFS (hazard ratio, 4.04 [95% CI: 1.90, 8.60]; P < .001) and was associated with upregulation of biologic pathways related to tumor proliferation. Conclusion: A nomogram model combining ITH score and clinicopathologic variables showed good performance in predicting pCR to NAC and RFS. © 2025 Radiological Society of North America Inc..

  abstract={Rationale and objectives: To investigate the value of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)-based radiomics at baseline and after two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and associated longitudinal changes for early prediction of the NAT response in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: One hundred seventeen patients with breast cancer who underwent DCE-MRI before NAT and after two cycles of NAT from April 2019 to November 2021 were enrolled retrospectively. Patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 81) and a test set (n = 36) at a ratio of 7:3. Clinical-pathological data and the relative tumor maximum diameter regression value (diameter%) were also collected. A total of 851 radiomic features were extracted from the phase with the most pronounced tumor enhancement on DCE-MRI T1 imaging acquired both pre- and post-treatment. Delta and delta% radiomics features were also calculated. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method was applied to select features, and a logistic regression model was used to calculate pre-NAT, early-NAT, delta, and delta% radscores and then select among four radscores to build a Fusion radiomics model. The final clinical-radiomics model was constructed by combining fusion radscores and clinical-pathological variables. The discrimination and clinical utility of the models were further evaluated and compared. Results: The area under the curve (AUC) values of the fusion radiomics model based on pre-NAT, Delta, and Delta% radscores were 0.868 of 0.825. The clinical-radiomics model integrating Fusion radscores and clinical-pathological variables achieved AUC values of 0.920 of 0.884, which were higher than those of the clinical model constructed by AUC values (0.858/0.831), although no significant improvement was observed in the test set (Delong test, p = 0.196). Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the clinical-radiomics model demonstrated more clinical utility than the clinical model. Conclusion: DCE-MRI-based radiomics features may have potential for pathological complete response (pCR) prediction in the early phase of NAT. By combining radiomics features and clinical-pathological characteristics, higher diagnostic performance can be achieved. © 2022 The Association of University Radiologists},

  abstract={Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a machine learning model developed using radiomics data derived from physiologically decomposed diffusion-weighted MRI data for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer compared with baseline and benchmark models. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included data from the Breast Multiparametric MRI for prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Response (BMMR2) challenge dataset, comprising longitudinal multiparametric breast MRI studies (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI] and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI) from participants enrolled in the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01042379). Piecewise linear physiologic decomposition was applied to DWI data (PD DWI) to isolate pseudo-diffusion, pure-diffusion, and pseudo-diffusion fraction components for radiomics feature extraction. These features were used to develop a boosted decision tree model to predict pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Model performance was compared with performance of baseline models, including data on tumor size and mean apparent diffusion coefficient, and the BMMR2 challenge benchmark model using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, F1 score, and positive and negative predictive values. Model calibration was assessed via the Brier score, and a decision curve analysis was performed to estimate the potential reduction in unnecessary interventions when using the proposed model. Results: The study included multiparametric MRI scans from 190 female participants (mean age ± SD, 48.4 years ± 10.5). PD DWI achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.89, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.96) among all evaluated models, demonstrating statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches (all P < .04). Decision curve analysis showed that the PD DWI model provided a greater net benefit compared with the BMMR2 challenge benchmark model (0.17, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.21 vs 0.09, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.13; P < .001). Conclusion: A machine learning model using radiomics data derived from PD DWI achieved higher performance than baseline and benchmark models in predicting pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

  abstract={Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the primary method to reduce the burden of tumor and metastasis; in the treatment of breast cancer, it may provide additional opportunities for breast-conserving surgery. Preoperative assessment of pathological complete response (PCR) to NAC is important for developing individualized treatment approaches and predicting patient prognosis. Compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography, ultrasonography (US) has the advantages of simplicity, flexibility, and real-time imaging. Moreover, it does not require radiation and can provide multi-time acquisition of the tumor during NAC treatment. Recently, deep learning radiomics models based on multi-time-point US images for the prediction of NAC effectiveness have been proposed. To further improve the prediction performance, we carefully designed four supporting modules for our proposed dual-input transformer (DiT): isolated tokens-to-token patch embedding module, shared position embedding, time embedding, and weighted average pooling feature representation modules. The design of each module considers the characteristics of the US images at multiple time points. We validated our model on our retrospective US dataset composed of 484 cases from two centers whose consistency is not sufficiently high. Patients were allocated to training (n = 297), validation (n = 99), and external test (n = 88) sets. The results show that our model can achieve better performance than the Siamese CNN and the standard tokens-to-token vision transformer without using multi-time-point images. The ablation study also proved the effectiveness of each module designed for DiT.  © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={Background: Breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is typically evaluated through the assessment of tumor size reduction after a few cycles of NAC. In case of treatment ineffectiveness, this results in the patient suffering potentially severe secondary effects without achieving any actual benefit. Purpose: To identify patients achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAC by spatio-temporal radiomic analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI images acquired before treatment. Study type: Single-center, retrospective. Population: A total of 251 DCE-MRI pretreatment images of breast cancer patients. Field strength/sequence: 1.5 T/3 T, T1-weighted DCE-MRI. Assessment: Tumor and peritumoral regions were segmented, and 348 radiomic features that quantify texture temporal variation, enhancement kinetics heterogeneity, and morphology were extracted. Based on subsets of features identified through forward selection, machine learning (ML) logistic regression models were trained separately with all images and stratifying on cancer molecular subtype and validated with leave-one-out cross-validation. Statistical tests: Feature significance was assessed using the Mann–Whitney U-test. Significance of the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of the ML models was assessed using the associated 95% confidence interval (CI). Significance threshold was set to 0.05, adjusted with Bonferroni correction. Results: Nine features related to texture temporal variation and enhancement kinetics heterogeneity were significant in the discrimination of cases achieving pCR vs. non-pCR. The ML models achieved significant AUC of 0.707 (all cancers, n = 251, 59 pCR), 0.824 (luminal A, n = 107, 14 pCR), 0.823 (luminal B, n = 47, 15 pCR), 0.844 (HER2 enriched, n = 25, 11 pCR), 0.803 (triple negative, n = 72, 19 pCR). Data Conclusions: Differences in imaging phenotypes were found between complete and noncomplete responders. Furthermore, ML models trained per cancer subtype achieved high performance in classifying pCR vs. non-pCR cases. They may, therefore, have potential to help stratify patients according to the level of response predicted before treatment, pending further validation with larger prospective cohorts.

  abstract={Purpose: To combine deep learning and biology-based modeling to predict the response of locally advanced, triple-negative breast cancer before initiating neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a biology-based mathematical model of tumor response to NAC was constructed and calibrated on a patient-specific basis using imaging data from patients enrolled in the MD Anderson A Robust TNBC Evaluation FraMework to Improve Survival trial (ARTEMIS; ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT02276443) between April 2018 and May 2021. To relate the calibrated parameters in the biology-based model and pretreatment MRI data, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed. The CNN predictions of the calibrated model parameters were used to estimate tumor response at the end of NAC. CNN performance in the estimations of total tumor volume (TTV), total tumor cellularity (TTC), and tumor status was evaluated. Model-predicted TTC and TTV measurements were compared with MRI-based measurements using the concordance correlation coefficient and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (for predicting pathologic complete response at the end of NAC). Results: The study included 118 female patients (median age, 51 years [range, 29–78 years]). For comparison of CNN predicted to measured change in TTC and TTV over the course of NAC, the concordance correlation coefficient values were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.98) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.97), respectively. CNN-predicted TTC and TTV had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.94) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.95) for predicting tumor status at the time of surgery, respectively. Conclusion: Deep learning integrated with a biology-based mathematical model showed good performance in predicting the spatial and temporal evolution of a patient’s tumor during NAC using only pre-NAC MRI data. © 2025, Radiological Society of North America Inc..

  abstract={Background: Breast cancer patients exhibit various response patterns to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However, it is uncertain whether diverse tumor response patterns to NAC in breast cancer patients can predict survival outcomes. We aimed to develop and validate radiomic signatures indicative of tumor shrinkage and therapeutic response for improved survival analysis. Methods: This retrospective, multicohort study included three datasets. The development dataset, consisting of preoperative and early NAC DCE-MRI data from 255 patients, was used to create an imaging signature-based multitask model for predicting tumor shrinkage patterns and pathological complete response (pCR). Patients were categorized as pCR, nonpCR with concentric shrinkage (CS), or nonpCR with non-CS, with prediction performance measured by the area under the curve (AUC). The prognostic validation dataset (n = 174) was used to assess the prognostic value of the imaging signatures for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) using a multivariate Cox model. The gene expression data (genomic validation dataset, n = 112) were analyzed to determine the biological basis of the response patterns. Results: The multitask learning model, utilizing 17 radiomic signatures, achieved AUCs of 0.886 for predicting tumor shrinkage and 0.760 for predicting pCR. Patients who achieved pCR had the best survival outcomes, while nonpCR patients with a CS pattern had better survival than non-CS patients did, with significant differences in OS and RFS (p = 0.00012 and p = 0.00063, respectively). Gene expression analysis highlighted the involvement of the IL-17 and estrogen signaling pathways in response variability. Conclusions: Radiomic signatures effectively predict NAC response patterns in breast cancer patients and are associated with specific survival outcomes. The CS pattern in nonpCR patients indicates better survival. © The Author(s) 2024.},

  abstract={Background: Accurate identification of pathologic complete response (pCR) from population-based electronic narrative data in a timely and cost-efficient manner is critical. This study aimed to derive and validate a set of natural language processing (NLP)-based machine-learning algorithms to capture pCR from surgical pathology reports of breast cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all invasive breast cancer patients who underwent NAC and subsequent curative-intent surgery during their admission at all four tertiary acute care hospitals in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2017. Surgical pathology reports were extracted and processed with NLP. Decision tree classifiers were constructed and validated against chart review results. Machine-learning algorithms were evaluated with a performance matrix including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value [NPV], accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], and F1 score. Results: The study included 351 female patients. Of these patients, 102 (29%) achieved pCR after NAC. The high-sensitivity model achieved a sensitivity of 90.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.6–98.9%), a PPV of 76% (95% CI, 59.6–87.2), an accuracy of 88.6% (95% CI, 78.7–94.9%), an AUC of 0.891 (95% CI, 0.795–0.987), and an F1 score of 82.61. The high-PPV algorithm reached a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI, 63.7–97%), a PPV of 81.8% (95% CI, 63.4–92.1%), an accuracy of 90% (95% CI, 80.5–95.9%), an AUC of 0.888 (95% CI, 0.790–0.985), and an F1 score of 83.72. The high-F1 score algorithm obtained a performance equivalent to that of the high-PPV algorithm. Conclusion: The developed algorithms demonstrated excellent accuracy in identifying pCR from surgical pathology reports of breast cancer patients who received NAC treatment. © 2022, Society of Surgical Oncology.},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: The aim of this study was to ascertain whether the utilization of multiple b-value diffusion-weighted habitat imaging, a technique that depicts tumor heterogeneity, could aid in identifying breast cancer patients who would derive substantial benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials and Methods: This prospective study enrolled 143 women (II–III breast cancer), who underwent multi-b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) before NAC. The patient cohort was partitioned into a training set (consisting of 100 patients, of which 36 demonstrated a pathologic complete response [pCR]) and a test set (featuring 43 patients, 16 of whom exhibited pCR). Utilizing the training set, predictive models for pCR, were constructed using different parameters: whole-tumor radiomics (ModelWH), diffusion-weighted habitat-imaging (ModelHabitats), conventional MRI features (ModelCF), along with combined models ModelHabitats+CF. The performance of these models was assessed based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration slope. Results: In the prediction of pCR, ModelWH, ModelHabitats, ModelCF, and ModelHabitats+CF achieved AUCs of 0.733, 0.722, 0.705, and 0.756 respectively, within the training set. These scores corresponded to AUCs of 0.625, 0.801, 0.700, and 0.824 respectively in the test set. The DeLong test revealed no significant difference between ModelWH and ModelHabitats (P = 0.182), between ModelHabitats and ModelHabitats+CF (P = 0.113). Conclusion: The habitat model we developed, incorporating first-order features along with conventional MRI features, has demonstrated accurate predication of pCR prior to NAC. This model holds the potential to augment decision-making processes in personalized treatment strategies for breast cancer. © 2024 The Association of University Radiologists},

  abstract={Characterization of breast parenchyma in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a challenging task owing to the complexity of underlying tissue structures. Existing quantitative approaches, like radiomics and deep learning models, lack explicit quantification of intricate and subtle parenchymal structures, including fibroglandular tissue. To address this, we propose a novel topological approach that explicitly extracts multi-scale topological structures to better approximate breast parenchymal structures, and then incorporates these structures into a deep-learning-based prediction model via an attention mechanism. Our topology-informed deep learning model, TopoTxR, leverages topology to provide enhanced insights into tissues critical for disease pathophysiology and treatment response. We empirically validate TopoTxR using the VICTRE phantom breast dataset, showing that the topological structures extracted by our model effectively approximate the breast parenchymal structures. We further demonstrate TopoTxR's efficacy in predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses suggest differential topological behavior of breast tissue in treatment-naïve imaging, in patients who respond favorably to therapy as achieving pathological complete response (pCR) versus those who do not. In a comparative analysis with several baselines on the publicly available I-SPY 1 dataset (N = 161, including 47 patients with pCR and 114 without) and the Rutgers proprietary dataset (N = 120, with 69 patients achieving pCR and 51 not), TopoTxR demonstrates a notable improvement, achieving a 2.6% increase in accuracy and a 4.6% enhancement in AUC compared to the state-of-the-art method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Purpose: Different imaging tools, including digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), are frequently used for evaluating tumor response during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). This study aimed to explore whether using artificial intelligence (AI) for serial DBT acquisitions during NACT for breast cancer can predict pathological complete response (pCR) after completion of NACT. Methods: A total of 149 women (mean age 53 years, pCR rate 22 %) with breast cancer treated with NACT at Skane University Hospital, Sweden, between 2014 and 2019, were prospectively included in this observational cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02306096). DBT images from both the cancer and contralateral healthy breasts acquired at three time points: pre-NACT, after two cycles of NACT, and after the completion of six cycles of NACT (pre-surgery) were analyzed. The deep learning AI system used to predict pCR consisted of a backbone 3D ResNet and an attention and prediction module. The GradCAM method was used to obtain insights into the model decision basis through a quantitative analysis of the importance maps on the validation set. Moreover, specific model choices were motivated by ablation studies. Results: The AI model reached an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.63–1.00) (test set). The spatial correlation of importance maps for input volumes from the same patient but at different time points was high, possibly indicating that the model focuses on the same areas during decision-making. Conclusions: We demonstrate a high discriminative performance of our algorithm for predicting pCR/non-pCR. Availability of larger datasets would permit more comprehensive training of the models and more rigorous evaluation of their prediction performance for future patients. © 2024 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become the standard therapeutic option for early high-risk and locally advanced breast cancer. However, response rates to NAC vary between patients, causing delays in treatment and affecting the prognosis for patients who do not sensitive to NAC. Materials and methods: In total, 211 breast cancer patients who completed NAC (training set: 155, validation set: 56) were retrospectively enrolled. we developed a deep learning radiopathomics model(DLRPM) by Support Vector Machine (SVM) method based on clinicopathological features, radiomics features, and pathomics features. Furthermore, we comprehensively validated the DLRPM and compared it with three single-scale signatures. Results: DLRPM had favourable performance for the prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) in the training set (AUC 0.933[95% CI 0.895–0.971]), and in the validation set (AUC 0.927 [95% CI 0.858–0.996]). In the validation set, DLRPM also significantly outperformed the radiomics signature (AUC 0.821[0.700–0.942]), pathomics signature (AUC 0.766[0.629–0.903]), and deep learning pathomics signature (AUC 0.804[0.683–0.925]) (all p < 0.05). The calibration curves and decision curve analysis also indicated the clinical effectiveness of the DLRPM. Conclusions: DLRPM can help clinicians accurately predict the efficacy of NAC before treatment, highlighting the potential of artificial intelligence to improve the personalized treatment of breast cancer patients. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Objectives: This study was designed to develop and validate models based on delta intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics features from breast masses on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for the prediction of axillary lymph node (ALN) pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in patients with breast cancer (BC). Methods: We retrospectively collected data from 187 BC patients with ALN metastases. Radiomics features were extracted from the intratumoral and 3 mm-peritumoral regions on DCE-MRI at baseline and after the 2nd course of NAT to calculate delta intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics features, respectively. After feature selection, the delta intratumoral radiomics (DIR) model and delta peritumoral radiomics (DPR) model were built using the retained features. An ultrasound model was constructed on the basis of preoperative axillary ultrasound results. All variables were screened by univariate and multivariate logistic regression to construct the combined model. The above models were evaluated and compared. Results: In the validation set, the ultrasound model had the lowest AUC, which was lower than those of the DIR, DPR and combined models (0.627 vs 0.825, 0.687, 0.846, respectively). The combined model constructed by delta dual-region radiomics and ultrasound dianogsis was significantly better than the ultrasound model in terms of the Delong test and integrated discrimination improvement (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Delta intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics based on DCE-MRI have the potential to predict ALN status after NAT. The combined model based on delta dual-region radiomics of breast mass can accurately diagnose ALN-pCR and provide assistance in the selection of axillary surgical approaches for patients. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={Purpose: Accurate identification of primary breast cancer and axillary positive-node response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is important for determining appropriate surgery strategies. We aimed to develop combining models based on breast multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging and clinicopathologic characteristics for predicting therapeutic response of primary tumor and axillary positive-node prior to treatment. Materials and methods: A total of 268 breast cancer patients who completed NAC and underwent surgery were enrolled. Radiomics features and clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed through the analysis of variance and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. Finally, 24 and 28 optimal features were selected to construct machine learning models based on 6 algorithms for predicting each clinical outcome, respectively. The diagnostic performances of models were evaluated in the testing set by the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: Of the 268 patients, 94 (35.1 %) achieved breast cancer pathological complete response (bpCR) and of the 240 patients with clinical positive-node, 120 (50.0 %) achieved axillary lymph node pathological complete response (apCR). The multi-layer perception (MLP) algorithm yielded the best diagnostic performances in predicting apCR with an AUC of 0.825 (95 % CI, 0.764–0.886) and an accuracy of 77.1 %. And MLP also outperformed other models in predicting bpCR with an AUC of 0.852 (95 % CI, 0.798–0.906) and an accuracy of 81.3 %. Conclusions: Our study established non-invasive combining models to predict the therapeutic response of primary breast cancer and axillary positive-node prior to NAC, which may help to modify preoperative treatment and determine post-NAC surgery strategy. © 2024},

  abstract={Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease in the female population and one of the most common diseases in developed countries. Many factors which may impact the development and outcome of this complex disease have been investigated. The aim of this study was to analyze factors that affect neoadjuvant therapy outcomes and create an outcome prediction model based on these factors. Materials and methods: Patient data was collected from all patients who underwent breast cancer neoadjuvant therapy at our clinical center from 2018 to 2022. Statistical analysis entailed the identification of patient and tumor features that are significantly associated with RCB index values, using Spearman's correlation coefficient, the Mann-Whitney U-test, and the one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test. Significant features were selected and used for the training of a machine-learning model based on the random forest algorithm. Results: Regarding patient features, age, BMI, and previous history of malignant disease were found significantly associated with the RCB index. Significant tumor features included focality, nuclear grade, immunophenotype, positivity for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and HER-2, Ki-67 value, and presence of lymphovascular invasion. Based on these features, a predictive model was created with an accuracy of 80 % and ROC-AUC value of 0.83. Conclusion: The discovered significant features are mostly in line with the published literature. While our predictive model yielded promising results, its training was limited by the number of patients and availability of data. Further research and the creation of more accurate predictive models might facilitate further personalization and improvement of breast cancer neoadjuvant treatment. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Purpose: To develop and test a radiomics nomogram based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinicopathological factors for predicting the axillary pathologic complete response (apCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases. Materials and Methods: A total of 319 patients who underwent MRI examination and received NAC treatment were enrolled from two centers, and the presence of ALN metastasis was confirmed by biopsy pathology before NAC. The radiomics features were extracted from regions of interest of ALNs before (pre-radiomics) and after (post-radiomics) NAC. The difference of features before and after NAC, named delta radiomics, was calculated. The variance threshold, selectKbest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm were used to select radiomics features. Radscore was calculated by a linear combination of selected features, weighted by their respective coefficients. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to select the clinicopathological factors and radscores, and a radiomics nomogram was built by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves. Furthermore, to explore the biological basis of radiomics nomogram, 16 patients with RNA-sequence data were included for genetic analysis. Results: The radiomics nomogram was constructed by two radscores (post- and delta- radscores) and one clinicopathological factor (progesterone hormone, PR), and showed powerful predictive performance in both internal and external test sets, with AUCs of 0.894 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.877–0.959) and 0.903 (95% CI, 0.801–0.986), respectively. The calibration curves and DCA showed favorable consistency and clinical utility. With the assistance of nomogram, the rate of unnecessary ALND would be reduced from 60.42% to 21.88%, and the rate of final benefit rate would be increased from 39.58% to 70.83%. Moreover, genetic analysis revealed that high apCR prediction scores were associated with the upregulation of immune-mediated genes and pathways. Conclusion: The radiomics nomogram showed great performance in predicting apCR after NAC for breast cancer patients, which could help clinicians to identify patients with apCR and avoid unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection. © 2025 The Association of University Radiologists},

  abstract={Background: This study aimed to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ER+HER2- locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), a subtype with limited treatment response. Methods: We included 265 ER+HER2- LABC patients (2010–2020) with pre-treatment MRI, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and confirmed pathology. Using data from January 2016, we divided them into training and validation cohorts. Volumes of interest (VOI) for the tumoral and peritumoral regions were segmented on preoperative MRI from three sequences: T1-weighted early and delayed contrast-enhanced sequences and T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequence (T2FS). We constructed seven machine learning models using tumoral, peritumoral, and combined texture features within and across the sequences, and evaluated their pCR prediction performance using AUC values. Results: The best single sequence model was SVM using a 1 mm tumor-to-peritumor VOI in the early contrast-enhanced phase (AUC = 0.9447). Among the combinations, the top-performing model was K-Nearest Neighbor, using 1 mm tumor-to-peritumor VOI in the early contrast-enhanced phase and 3 mm peritumoral VOI in T2FS (AUC = 0.9631). Conclusions: We suggest that a combined machine learning model that integrates tumoral and peritumoral radiomic features across different MRI sequences can provide a more accurate pretreatment pCR prediction for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+HER2- LABC. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Early prediction of patient responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is essential for the precision treatment of early breast cancer (EBC). Therefore, this study aims to noninvasively and early predict pathological complete response (pCR). We used dynamic ultrasound (US) imaging changes acquired during NACT, along with clinicopathological features, to create a nomogram and construct a machine learning model. This retrospective study included 304 EBC patients recruited from multiple centers. All enrollees had completed NACT regimens, and underwent US examinations at baseline and at each NACT cycle. We subsequently determined that percentage reduction of tumor maximum diameter from baseline to third cycle of NACT serves to independent predictor for pCR, enabling creation of a nomogram (). Our predictive accuracy further improved () by combining dynamic US data and clinicopathological features in a machine learning model. Such models may offer a means of accurately predicting NACT responses in this setting, helping to individualize patient therapy. Our study may provide additional insights into the US-based response prediction by focusing on the dynamic changes of the tumor in the early and full NACT cycle. © The Author(s) 2024.},

  abstract={Background: This study developed a nomogram model using CT-based delta-radiomics features and clinical factors to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Methods: The study retrospectively analyzed 232 ESCC patients who underwent pretreatment and post-treatment CT scans. Patients were divided into training (n = 186) and validation (n = 46) sets through fivefold cross-validation. 837 radiomics features were extracted from regions of interest (ROIs) delineations on CT images before and after nCRT to calculate delta values. The LASSO algorithm selected delta-radiomics features (DRF) based on classification performance. Logistic regression constructed a nomogram incorporating DRFs and clinical factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analyses evaluated nomogram performance for predicting pCR. Results: No significant differences existed between the training and validation datasets. The 4-feature delta-radiomics signature (DRS) demonstrated good predictive accuracy for pCR, with α-binormal-based and empirical AUCs of 0.871 and 0.869. T-stage (p = 0.001) and differentiation degree (p = 0.018) were independent predictors of pCR. The nomogram combined the DRS and clinical factors improved the classification performance in the training dataset (AUCαbin = 0.933 and AUCemp = 0.941). The validation set showed similar performance with AUCs of 0.958 and 0.962. Conclusions: The CT-based delta-radiomics nomogram model with clinical factors provided high predictive accuracy for pCR in ESCC patients after nCRT. © The Author(s) 2024.},

In this study, we aimed to quantify the dynamic characteristics of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRI) and investigate its value to improve pCR prediction as well as its association with tumor heterogeneity in breast cancer patients. Methods: The DCE-MRI, clinicopathologic record, and full transcriptomic data of 785 breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were retrospectively included from a public dataset. Dynamic features of DCE-MRI were computed from extracted phase-varying radiomic feature series using 22 CAnonical Time-sereis CHaracteristics. Dynamic model and radiomic model were developed by logistic regression using dynamic features and traditional radiomic features respectively. Various combined models with clinical factors were also developed to find the optimal combination and the significance of each components was evaluated. All the models were evaluated in independent test set in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). To explore the potential underlying biological mechanisms, radiogenomic analysis was implemented on patient subgroups stratified by dynamic model to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways. Results: A 10-feature dynamic model and a 4-feature radiomic model were developed (AUC = 0.688, 95%CI: 0.635–0.741 and AUC = 0.650, 95%CI: 0.595–0.705) and tested (AUC = 0.686, 95%CI: 0.594–0.778 and AUC = 0.626, 95%CI: 0.529–0.722), with the dynamic model showing slightly higher AUC (train p = 0.181, test p = 0.222). The combined model of clinical, radiomic, and dynamic achieved the highest AUC in pCR prediction (train: 0.769, 95%CI: 0.722–0.816 and test: 0.762, 95%CI: 0.679–0.845). Compared with clinical-radiomic combined model (train AUC = 0.716, 95%CI: 0.665–0.767 and test AUC = 0.695, 95%CI: 0.656–0.714), adding the dynamic component brought significant improvement in model performance (train p < 0.001 and test p = 0.005). Radiogenomic analysis identified 297 DEGs, including CXCL9, CCL18, and HLA-DPB1 which are known to be associated with breast cancer prognosis or angiogenesis. Gene set enrichment analysis further revealed enrichment of gene ontology terms and pathways related to immune system. Conclusion: Dynamic characteristics of DCE-MRI were quantified and used to develop dynamic model for improving pCR prediction in breast cancer patients. The dynamic model was associated with tumor heterogeniety in prognostic-related gene expression and immune-related pathways. © The Author(s) 2024.},

  abstract={The early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) determines individualized treatment and prognosis in breast cancer patients. The study aimed to develop a biologically interpretable MRI-based radiomics model for predicting pCR. A total of 843 eligible breast cancer patients were retrospectively recruited from three medical centers and further divided into training, internal, and external validation cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from tumors and 4 mm peritumor regions on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI images. Independent clinical-pathological factors and important radiomics features were determined step by step; then a pCR-related hybrid model was constructed with AUCs of 0.802 to 0.893, which significantly outperformed the junior (AUCs of 0.623 to 0.761) and senior radiologists (AUCs of 0.648 to 0.771) with both DeLong test p < 0.05 in three cohorts. The prognostic stratification efficacy associated with disease-free survival was demonstrated in three cohorts with both log-rank p < 0.05. In terms of interpretability, the prediction contribution of the important radiomics features was first quantified by SHapley Additive exPlanation analysis. Furthermore, 120 eligible patients with DCE-MRI and bulk-RNA information were recruited from the TCGA-BRCA cohort to explore the underlying biological information for the radiomics model. Radiogenomics analysis revealed that the predicted pCR group has active immune and inflammatory pathways, while the non-pCR group performed a stronger cell proliferation and tumor invasion processes. In conclusion, these findings established an MRI-based biologically interpretable pCR predictive tool, which has the potential to individually guide clinical decision making. © 2025 UICC.},

  abstract={Objective: Early predicting response before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is crucial for personalized treatment plans for locally advanced breast cancer patients. We aim to develop a multi-task model using multiscale whole slide images (WSIs) features to predict the response to breast cancer NAC more finely. Methods: This work collected 1,670 whole slide images for training and validation sets, internal testing sets, external testing sets, and prospective testing sets of the weakly-supervised deep learning-based multi-task model (DLMM) in predicting treatment response and pCR to NAC. Our approach models two-by-two feature interactions across scales by employing concatenate fusion of single-scale feature representations, and controls the expressiveness of each representation via a gating-based attention mechanism. Results: In the retrospective analysis, DLMM exhibited excellent predictive performance for the prediction of treatment response, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.869 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.806−0.933] in the internal testing set and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.814−0.867) in the external testing sets. For the pCR prediction task, DLMM reached AUCs of 0.865 (95% CI: 0.763−0.964) in the internal testing and 0.821 (95% CI: 0.763−0.878) in the pooled external testing set. In the prospective testing study, DLMM also demonstrated favorable predictive performance, with AUCs of 0.829 (95% CI: 0.754−0.903) and 0.821 (95% CI: 0.692−0.949) in treatment response and pCR prediction, respectively. DLMM significantly outperformed the baseline models in all testing sets (P<0.05). Heatmaps were employed to interpret the decision-making basis of the model. Furthermore, it was discovered that high DLMM scores were associated with immune-related pathways and cells in the microenvironment during biological basis exploration. Conclusions: The DLMM represents a valuable tool that aids clinicians in selecting personalized treatment strategies for breast cancer patients. © Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

  abstract={Background: To develop and validate a peritumoral vascular and intratumoral radiomics model to improve pretreatment predictions for pathologic complete responses (pCRs) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NAC) in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods: A total of 282 TNBC patients (93 in the primary cohort, 113 in the validation cohort, and 76 in The Cancer Imaging Archive [TCIA] cohort) were retrospectively included. The peritumoral vasculature on the maximum intensity projection (MIP) from pretreatment DCE-MRI was segmented by a Hessian matrix-based filter and then edited by a radiologist. Radiomics features were extracted from the tumor and peritumoral vasculature of the MIP images. The LASSO method was used for feature selection, and the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier was trained and validated to build a predictive model. The diagnostic performance was assessed using the ROC analysis. Results: One hundred of the 282 patient (35.5%) with TNBC achieved pCRs after NAC. In predicting pCRs, the combined peritumoral vascular and intratumoral model (fusion model) yields a maximum AUC of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.88) in the primary cohort, a maximum AUC of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.76) in the internal validation cohort, and a maximum AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.78) in TCIA cohort. The fusion model showed improved performance over the intratumoral model and the peritumoral vascular model, but not significantly (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This study suggested that combined peritumoral vascular and intratumoral radiomics model could provide a non-invasive tool to enable prediction of pCR in TNBC patients treated with NAC. © The Author(s) 2024.},

  abstract={Purpose: The aim of this work is to compare different machine learning models for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer using radiomics features from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Method: The study included 55 patients with breast cancer, among whom 18 achieved pCR and 37 did not respond completely to NAC (non-pCR). After some pre-processing steps, 1446 features were extracted and corrected for batch effects using ComBat. Five machine learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), were evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as classification metrics. A Leave-Group-Out cross validation (LGOCV) was applied in the outer loop. Results: RF and DT models exhibited the highest performances compared to the other algorithms. DT achieved an accuracy of 0.96 ± 0.07, and RF achieved 0.95 ± 0.05. The AUC values for RF and DT were 0.98 ± 0.06 and 0.94 ± 0.07, respectively. LR and k-NN demonstrated lower performance across all metrics, while XGB showed competitive results but slightly lower than RF and DT. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of radiomics and machine learning for predicting pCR to NAC in breast cancer. RF and DT models proved to be the most effective in capturing underlying patterns in radiomics data. Further research is required to validate and strengthen the proposed approach and explore its applicability in diverse radiomics datasets and clinical scenarios. © 2025 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica e Sanitaria},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: To compare the value of radiomics and diameter% based on pre- and early-treatment dynamic enhanced MR (DCE-MRI) of the breast in predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer and to construct a tool for early noninvasive prediction of NAT outcomes. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data of 142 patients with primary invasive breast cancer who underwent DCE-MRI before and after two cycles of NAT at our institution. Enroled patients were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to the training group and the test group. Patients were divided into pathological complete response (pCR) and non-pathological complete response groups based on surgical pathology findings after NAT. The maximum diameter relative regression values (Diameter%) before and after treatment were calculated and the conventional imaging Diameter% model was constructed. Based on pre- and early-NAT DCE-MRI, the optimal features of pre-NAT, early-NAT, and delta radiomics were screened using redundancy analysis, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator methods to construct the corresponding radiomics model and calculate the Radscores. Indicators that were statistically significant in the univariate analysis of clinical data were further screened by stepwise regression and combined with Radscores to construct the fusion model. All models were evaluated and compared. Results: In the test set, the area under the curve (AUC) of the delta radiomics model (0.87) was higher than that of the pre-NAT, early-NAT radiomics models (0.57, 0.78) and the Diameter% model (0.83). The fusion model had the best efficacy in predicting pCR after NAT, with AUCs of 0.91 in the training and test sets. And its nomogram plot showed that Radscore of early-NAT radiomics had the greatest weight. In the test set, the fusion model and Delta radiomics model improved the efficacy of predicting pCR by 35.56% and 14.19%, respectively, compared to the Diameter% model (P = 0 and .039). Clinical decision curves showed the highest overall clinical benefit for the fusion model. Conclusion: Radiomics, especially delta and early-NAT radiomics, may be potential biomarkers for early noninvasive prediction of NAT outcomes. And a fusion model constructed from meaningful clinicopathological indicators combined with radiomics can effectively predict NAT response. © 2023 The Association of University Radiologists},

  abstract={Purpose: Several predictive models have been developed to predict the pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC); however, few are broadly applicable owing to radiologic complexity and institution-specific clinical variables, and none have been externally validated. This study aimed to develop and externally validate a machine learning model that predicts pCR after NAC in patients with breast cancer using routinely collected clinical and demographic variables. Methods: The electronic medical records of patients with advanced breast cancer who underwent NAC before surgical resection between January 2017 and December 2020 were reviewed. Patient data from Seoul National University Bundang Hospital were divided into training and internal validation cohorts. Five machine learning techniques, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, and neural network, were used to build predictive models, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was compared to select the best model. Finally, the model was validated using an independent cohort from Seoul National University Hospital. Results: A total of 1,003 patients were included in the study: 287, 71, and 645 in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. Overall, 36.3% of the patients achieved pCR. Among the five machine learning models, the GBM showed the highest AUC for pCR prediction (AUC, 0.903; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.833–0.972). External validation confirmed an AUC of 0.833 (95% CI, 0.800–0.865). Conclusion: Commonly available clinical and demographic variables were used to develop a machine learning model for predicting pCR following NAC. External validation of the model demonstrated good discrimination power, indicating that routinely collected variables were sufficient to build a good prediction model. © 2023 Korean Breast Cancer Society.},

  abstract={Background: Most models of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for breast cancer (BC) suffer from insufficient data and lack interpretability. Additionally, there is a notable absence of reports from China in this field. This study is also the first to integrate the Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index (ALI) into such a model to evaluate its effectiveness. Methods: Data from 3,036 female BC patients receiving NACT at Heilongjiang Provincial Tumor Hospital (2008–2019, median follow-up 7.28 years) were analyzed. After screening, 2,909 patients were randomized into training and validation cohorts (7:3). Using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), the best predicting pathological complete response (pCR) model was identified, and key features were interpreted. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox algorithm, combined with XGBoost and Random Forest (RF) models, identified 9 overlapping prognostic features, enhancing the nomogram’s predictive accuracy for overall survival (OS). Kaplan–Meier (KM) analysis revealed varying prognostic outcomes. Results: The XGBoost model performed best in predicting pCR, with Area Under Curve (AUC) values of 0.88 and 0.72 in the training and validation sets, respectively. SHAP analysis indicated that ER, HER2 status, ALI, and albumin (Alb) level were the four most important features. The prognostic model was also validated by high AUC values in both training and test sets. KM analysis indicated that lower ALI, non-pCR, and triple-negative BC manifested as worse clinical outcomes. However, the adverse impact of ALI on the prognosis of this cohort was mainly reflected in the long-term recurrence outcomes and non-pCR groups. Conclusion: This study is the first to introduce ALI into the prediction model for BC completing NACT and develop a large-sample model based on XGBoost. Owing to the particularity of the indicators, training and validation were conducted on real clinical data. © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={Background: Accurate prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has significant clinical utility in the management of breast cancer treatment. Although multimodal deep learning models have shown promise for predicting pCR from medical imaging and other clinical data, their adoption has been limited due to challenges with interpretability and generalizability across institutions. Methods: We developed a multimodal deep learning model combining post contrast-enhanced whole-breast MRI at pre- and post-treatment timepoints with non-imaging clinical features. The model integrates 3D convolutional neural networks and self-attention to capture spatial and cross-modal interactions. We utilized two public multi-institutional datasets to perform internal and external validation of the model. For model training and validation, we used data from the I-SPY 2 trial (N = 660). For external validation, we used the I-SPY 1 dataset (N = 114). Results: Of the 660 patients in I-SPY 2, 217 patients achieved pCR (32.88%). Of the 114 patients in I-SPY 1, 29 achieved pCR (25.44%). The attention-based multimodal model yielded the best predictive performance with an AUC of 0.73 ± 0.04 on the internal data and an AUC of 0.71 ± 0.02 on the external dataset. The MRI-only model (internal AUC = 0.68 ± 0.03, external AUC = 0.70 ± 0.04) and the non-MRI clinical features-only model (internal AUC = 0.66 ± 0.08, external AUC = 0.71 ± 0.03) trailed in performance, indicating the combination of both modalities is most effective. Conclusion: We present a robust and interpretable deep learning framework for pCR prediction in breast cancer patients undergoing NAC. By combining imaging and clinical data with attention-based fusion, the model achieves strong predictive performance and generalizes across institutions. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={The goal of this study was to employ novel deep-learning convolutional-neural-network (CNN) to predict pathological complete response (PCR), residual cancer burden (RCB), and progression-free survival (PFS) in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy using longitudinal multiparametric MRI, demographics, and molecular subtypes as inputs. In the I-SPY-1 TRIAL, 155 patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer with breast tumors underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The inputs were dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, and T2- weighted MRI as three-dimensional whole-images without the tumor segmentation, as well as molecular subtypes and demographics. The outcomes were PCR, RCB, and PFS. Three (“Integrated”, “Stack” and “Concatenation”) CNN were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristics and mean absolute errors. The Integrated approach outperformed the “Stack” or “Concatenation” CNN. Inclusion of both MRI and non-MRI data outperformed either alone. The combined pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy data outperformed either alone. Using the best model and data combination, PCR prediction yielded an accuracy of 0.81±0.03 and AUC of 0.83±0.03; RCB prediction yielded an accuracy of 0.80±0.02 and Cohen’s κ of 0.73±0.03; PFS prediction yielded a mean absolute error of 24.6±0.7 months (survival ranged from 6.6 to 127.5 months). Deep learning using longitudinal multiparametric MRI, demographics, and molecular subtypes accurately predicts PCR, RCB, and PFS in breast cancer patients. This approach may prove useful for treatment selection, planning, execution, and mid-treatment adjustment. © 2023 Dammu et al.

  abstract={Background: Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) has significantly increased the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), although predictors of response to this regimen have not been identified. Purpose: To investigate pretreatment perfusion MRI–based radiomics as a predictive marker for pCR in patients with TNBC undergoing NACI. Materials and Methods: This prospective study enrolled women with early-stage TNBC who underwent NACI at two different centers from August 2021 to July 2023. Pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans obtained using scanners from multiple vendors were analyzed using the Tofts model to segment tumors and analyze pharmacokinetic parameters. Radiomics features were extracted from the rate constant for contrast agent plasma-to-interstitial transfer (or Ktrans), volume fraction of extravascular and extracellular space (Ve), and maximum contrast agent uptake rate (Slopemax) maps and analyzed using unsupervised correlation and least absolute shrinkage and selector operator, or LASSO, to develop a radiomics score. Score effectiveness was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and multivariable logistic regression was used to develop a multimodal nomogram for enhanced prediction. The discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the nomogram were evaluated in an external test set. Results: The training set included 112 female participants from center 1 (mean age, 52 years ± 11 [SD]), and the external test set included 83 female participants from center 2 (mean age, 47 years ± 11). The radiomics score demonstrated an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.89) for predicting pCR. A nomogram incorporating the radiomics score, grade, and Ki-67 yielded an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.94) in the test set. Associations were found between higher radiomics score (>0.25) and tumor size (P < .001), washout enhancement (P = .01), androgen receptor expression (P = .009), and programmed death ligand 1 expression (P = .01), demonstrating a correlation with tumor immune environment in participants with TNBC. Conclusion: A radiomics score derived from pharmacokinetic parameters at pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI exhibited good performance for predicting pCR in participants with TNBC undergoing NACI, and could potentially be used to enhance clinical decision making. © RSNA, 2024.},

  abstract={Purpose To predict pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with MRI and non-imaging data at multiple treatment timepoints. Material and methods This retrospective study included breast cancer patients (n = 117) who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Data types used included tumor ADC values, diffusion-weighted and dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI at three treatment timepoints, and patient demographics and tumor data. GLCM textural analysis was performed on MRI data. An extreme gradient boosting machine learning algorithm was used to predict pCR. Prediction performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating curve along with precision and recall. Results Prediction using texture features of DWI and DCE images at multiple treatment time points (AUC = 0.871; 95% CI: (0.768, 0.974; p<0.001) and (AUC = 0.903 95% CI: 0.854, 0.952; p<0.001) respectively), outperformed that using mean tumor ADC (AUC = 0.850 (95% CI: 0.764, 0.936; p<0.001)). The AUC using all MRI data was 0.933 (95% CI: 0.836, 1.03; p<0.001). The AUC using non-MRI data was 0.919 (95% CI: 0.848, 0.99; p<0.001). The highest AUC of 0.951 (95% CI: 0.909, 0.993; p<0.001) was achieved with all MRI and all non-MRI data at all time points as inputs. Conclusion Using XGBoost on extracted GLCM features and non-imaging data accurately predicts pCR. This early prediction of response can minimize exposure to toxic chemotherapy, allowing regimen modification mid-treatment and ultimately achieving better outcomes. © 2023 Syed et al.

  abstract={Background: Pathological complete response (pCR) is associated with favorable prognosis in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, only 30–40% of TNBC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) show pCR, while the remaining 60–70% show residual disease (RD). The role of the tumor microenvironment in NAC response in patients with TNBC remains unclear. In this study, we developed a machine learning-based two-step pipeline to distinguish between various histological components in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) of TNBC tissue biopsies and to identify histological features that can predict NAC response. Methods: H&E-stained WSIs of treatment-naïve biopsies from 85 patients (51 with pCR and 34 with RD) of the model development cohort and 79 patients (41 with pCR and 38 with RD) of the validation cohort were separated through a stratified eightfold cross-validation strategy for the first step and leave-one-out cross-validation strategy for the second step. A tile-level histology label prediction pipeline and four machine-learning classifiers were used to analyze 468,043 tiles of WSIs. The best-trained classifier used 55 texture features from each tile to produce a probability profile during testing. The predicted histology classes were used to generate a histology classification map of the spatial distributions of different tissue regions. A patient-level NAC response prediction pipeline was trained with features derived from paired histology classification maps. The top graph-based features capturing the relevant spatial information across the different histological classes were provided to the radial basis function kernel support vector machine (rbfSVM) classifier for NAC treatment response prediction. Results: The tile-level prediction pipeline achieved 86.72% accuracy for histology class classification, while the patient-level pipeline achieved 83.53% NAC response (pCR vs. RD) prediction accuracy of the model development cohort. The model was validated with an independent cohort with tile histology validation accuracy of 83.59% and NAC prediction accuracy of 81.01%. The histological class pairs with the strongest NAC response predictive ability were tumor and tumor tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for pCR and microvessel density and polyploid giant cancer cells for RD. Conclusion: Our machine learning pipeline can robustly identify clinically relevant histological classes that predict NAC response in TNBC patients and may help guide patient selection for NAC treatment. © 2024, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Multi-modal image analysis using deep learning (DL) lays the foundation for neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) response monitoring. However, existing methods prioritize extracting multi-modal features to enhance predictive performance, with limited consideration on real-world clinical applicability, particularly in longitudinal NAT scenarios with multi-modal data. Here, we propose the Multi-modal Response Prediction (MRP) system, designed to mimic real-world physician assessments of NAT responses in breast cancer. To enhance feasibility, MRP integrates cross-modal knowledge mining and temporal information embedding strategy to handle missing modalities and remain less affected by different NAT settings. We validated MRP through multi-center studies and multinational reader studies. MRP exhibited comparable robustness to breast radiologists, outperforming humans in predicting pathological complete response in the Pre-NAT phase (ΔAUROC 14% and 10% on in-house and external datasets, respectively). Furthermore, we assessed MRP’s clinical utility impact on treatment decision-making. MRP may have profound implications for enrolment into NAT trials and determining surgery extensiveness. © The Author(s) 2024.},

  abstract={The primary objective of this paper is to develop a machine learning-based approach capable of predicting the treatment response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to enhance breast cancer treatment management. The proposed system aims to predict NAC outcomes across three categories: pathological complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD), by analyzing multimodal magnetic resonance images with clinical and molecular subtype markers. To ensure the comprehensiveness of our system design, texture radiomics were extracted from T1, T2, and STIR MRI modalities, along with functional radiomics from diffusion-weighted MRI at various b-values. The main rationale behind employing multiple b-values in collecting DW-MRI is to effectively capture the complexities of blood diffusion within the tumor microstructure. The proposed system comprises several key steps: (i) extracting texture and functional radiomics from T1, T2, STIR MRI, and DW-MRI data; (ii) identifying the most significant radiomics correlated with NAC treatment using a genetic algorithm; (iii) initially predicting the PR from alternative treatment responses utilizing the extracted textures and functional radiomics; and (iv) subsequently integrating clinical and molecular subtype markers with imaging radiomics to differentiate between CR and SD. Our proposed system is trained and validated through the utilization of a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation approach on various MRI scans from 109 subjects, of whom 27 had complete responses, 54 had partial responses, and 28 had no responses. The performance of the proposed system was assessed through the utilization of Cohen's Kappa and accuracy metrics, achieving 81.31% and 88.07%, respectively. Our various experiments showed that integrating clinical and molecular subtype markers with radiomics highlights the proposed system's efficiency in evaluating the tumor's response to NAC efficiently, outperforming predictions based solely on individual radiomics.INDEX TERMS Breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, MRI, DW-MRI, radiomics, tumor clinical markers, machine learning, treatment response prediction. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={Background: Invasive breast cancer patients are increasingly being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy; however, only a fraction of the patients respond to it completely. To prevent overtreatment, there is an urgent need for biomarkers to predict treatment response before administering the therapy. Methods: In this retrospective study, we developed hypothesis-driven interpretable biomarkers based on deep learning, to predict the pathological complete response (pCR, i.e., the absence of tumor cells in the surgical resection specimens) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy solely using digital pathology H&E images of pre-treatment breast biopsies. Our approach consists of two steps: First, we use deep learning to characterize aspects of the tumor micro-environment by detecting mitoses and segmenting tissue into several morphology compartments including tumor, lymphocytes and stroma. Second, we derive computational biomarkers from the segmentation and detection output to encode slide-level relationships of components of the tumor microenvironment, such as tumor and mitoses, stroma, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Results: We developed and evaluated our method on slides from n = 721 patients from three European medical centers with triple-negative and Luminal B breast cancers and performed external independent validation on n = 126 patients from a public dataset. We report the predictive value of the investigated biomarkers for predicting pCR with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.66 and 0.88 across the tested cohorts. Conclusion: The proposed computational biomarkers predict pCR, but will require more evaluation and finetuning for clinical application. Our results further corroborate the potential role of deep learning to automate TILs quantification, and their predictive value in breast cancer neoadjuvant treatment planning, along with automated mitoses quantification. We made our method publicly available to extract segmentation-based biomarkers for research purposes. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the clinical utility of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) evaluated by “average” and “hot-spot” methods in breast cancer patients. Methods: We examined 367 breast cancer patients without neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) by average and hot-spot methods to determine the consistency of TIL scores between biopsy and surgical specimens. TIL scores before NAC were also compared with the pathological complete response (pCR) rate and clinical outcomes in 144 breast cancer patients that received NAC. TIL scores evaluated by the two methods were predicted from clinicopathological data using random forest regression. Results: Surgical specimens showed higher TIL scores than biopsy specimens using the hot-spot method (p < 0.001), while biopsy and surgical specimens showed similar TIL scores using the average method. There was a linear relationship between the pCR rate and TIL scores determined using hot-spot (p < 0.001) and average methods (p = 0.001). Patients without pCR and low TILs by the average method had significantly worse overall survival compared to other patients (p = 0.02). The root mean squared errors of the predicted TIL score for the test set were 19.662 (hot-spot) and 10.955 (average). Conclusion: The average method may have an advantage for breast cancer patients receiving NAC, since the TIL score using this method is more consistent between biopsy and surgical specimens, and it associates better with clinical outcomes. Our exploratory study showed that machine learning from clinicopathological data may better predict TIL scores assessed by the average, rather than hot-spot, method. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={The aim of our retrospective study is to develop and externally validate an 18F-FDG PET-derived radiomics model for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients. A total of 87 breast cancer patients underwent curative surgery after NAC at Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital and were randomly assigned to a training cohort and an internal validation cohort. Radiomic features were extracted from pretreatment PET images. A radiomic-score model was generated using the LASSO method. A combination model incorporating significant clinical variables was constructed. These models were externally validated in a separate cohort of 28 patients from Soonchunhyang University Buscheon Hospital. The model performances were assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC). Seven radiomic features were selected to calculate the radiomic-score. Among clinical variables, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status was an independent predictor of pCR. The radiomic-score model achieved good discriminability, with AUCs of 0.963, 0.731, and 0.729 for the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. The combination model showed improved predictive performance compared to the radiomic-score model alone, with AUCs of 0.993, 0.772, and 0.906 in three cohorts, respectively. The 18F-FDG PET-derived radiomic-based model is useful for predicting pCR after NAC in breast cancer. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: Early prediction of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer patients can facilitate timely adjustment of treatment regimens. We aimed to develop and validate a MRI-based enhanced self-attention network (MESN) for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) based on longitudinal images at the early stage of NAT. Methods: Two imaging datasets were utilized: a subset from the ACRIN 6698 trial (dataset A, n = 227) and a prospective collection from a Chinese hospital (dataset B, n = 245). These datasets were divided into three cohorts: an ACRIN 6698 training cohort (n = 153) from dataset A, an ACRIN 6698 test cohort (n = 74) from dataset A, and an external test cohort (n = 245) from dataset B. The proposed MESN allowed for the integration of multiple timepoint features and extraction of dynamic information from longitudinal MR images before and after early-NAT. We also constructed the Pre model based on pre-NAT MRI features. Clinicopathological characteristics were added to these image-based models to create integrated models (MESN-C and Pre-C), and their performance was evaluated and compared. Results: The MESN-C yielded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.944 (95% CI: 0.906 − 0.973), 0.903 (95%CI: 0.815 − 0.965), and 0.861 (95%CI: 0.811 − 0.906) in the ACRIN 6698 training, ACRIN 6698 test and external test cohorts, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the clinical model (AUC: 0.720 [95%CI: 0.587 − 0.842], 0.738 [95%CI: 0.669 − 0.796] for the two test cohorts, respectively; p < 0.05) and Pre-C (AUC: 0.697 [95%CI: 0.554 − 0.819], 0.726 [95%CI: 0.666 − 0.797] for the two test cohorts, respectively; p < 0.05). High AUCs of the MESN-C maintained in the ACRIN 6698 standard (AUC = 0.853 [95%CI: 0.676 − 1.000]) and experimental (AUC = 0.905 [95%CI: 0.817 − 0.993]) subcohorts, and the interracial and external subcohort (AUC = 0.861 [95%CI: 0.811 − 0.906]). Moreover, the MESN-C increased the positive predictive value from 48.6 to 71.3% compared with Pre-C model, and maintained a high negative predictive value (80.4–86.7%). Conclusion: The MESN-C using longitudinal multiparametric MRI after a short-term therapy achieved favorable performance for predicting pCR, which could facilitate timely adjustment of treatment regimens, increasing the rates of pCR and avoiding toxic effects.

  abstract={Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the potential additional value of deep radiomics for assessing residual cancer burden (RCB) in locally advanced breast cancer, after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) but before surgery, compared to standard predictors: tumor volume and subtype. Materials and methods: This retrospective study used a 105-patient single-institution training set and a 41-patient external test set from three institutions in the LIMA trial. DCE-MRI was performed before and after NAC, and RCB was determined post-surgery. Three networks (nnU-Net, Attention U-net and vector-quantized encoder-decoder) were trained for tumor segmentation. For each network, deep features were extracted from the bottleneck layer and used to train random forest regression models to predict RCB score. Models were compared to (1) a model trained on tumor volume and (2) a model combining tumor volume and subtype. The potential complementary performance of combining deep radiomics with a clinical-radiological model was assessed. From the predicted RCB score, three metrics were calculated: area under the curve (AUC) for categories RCB-0/RCB-I versus RCB-II/III, pathological complete response (pCR) versus non-pCR, and Spearman’s correlation. Results: Deep radiomics models had an AUC between 0.68–0.74 for pCR and 0.68–0.79 for RCB, while the volume-only model had an AUC of 0.74 and 0.70 for pCR and RCB, respectively. Spearman’s correlation varied from 0.45–0.51 (deep radiomics) to 0.53 (combined model). No statistical difference between models was observed. Conclusions: Segmentation network-derived deep radiomics contain similar information to tumor volume and subtype for inferring pCR and RCB after NAC, but do not complement standard clinical predictors in the LIMA trial. Key Points: Question It is unknown if and which deep radiomics approach is most suitable to extract relevant features to assess neoadjuvant chemotherapy response on breast MRI. Findings Radiomic features extracted from deep-learning networks yield similar results in predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response as tumor volume and subtype in the LIMA study. However, they do not provide complementary information. Clinical relevance For predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, tumor volume on MRI and subtype remain important predictors of treatment outcome; deep radiomics might be an alternative when determining tumor volume and/or subtype is not feasible. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={Accurately predicting pathological complete response (pCR) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is crucial for patients with breast cancer. In this study, we developed a multimodal integrated fully automated pipeline system (MIFAPS) in forecasting pCR to NAC, using a multicenter and prospective dataset of 1004 patients with locally advanced breast cancer, incorporating pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging, whole slide image, and clinical risk factors. The results demonstrated that MIFAPS offered a favorable predictive performance in both the pooled external test set [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.882] and the prospective test set (AUC = 0.909). In addition, MIFAPS significantly outperformed single-modality models (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the high deep learning scores were associated with immune-related pathways and the promotion of antitumor cells in the microenvironment during biological basis exploration. Overall, our study demonstrates a promising approach for improving the prediction of pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer through the integration of multimodal data.

  abstract={Background: The I-SPY 2 trial is a national-wide, multi-institutional clinical trial designed to evaluate multiple new therapeutic drugs for high-risk breast cancer. Previous studies suggest that pathological complete response (pCR) is a viable indicator of long-term outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer. While pCR can be assessed during surgery after the chemotherapy, early prediction of pCR before the completion of the chemotherapy may facilitate personalized treatment management to achieve an improved outcome. Notably, the acquisition of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCEMR) images at multiple time points during the I-SPY 2 trial opens up the possibility of achieving early pCR prediction. Purpose: In this study, we investigated the feasibility of the early prediction of pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using multi-time point DCEMR images and clinical data acquired in the I-SPY2 trial. The prediction uncertainty was also quantified to allow physicians to make patient-specific decisions on treatment plans based on the level of associated uncertainty. Methods: The dataset used in our study included 624 patients with DCEMR images acquired at 3 time points before the completion of the chemotherapy: pretreatment (T0), after 3 cycles of treatment (T1), and after 12 cycles of treatment (T2). A convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based deep learning model, which integrated multi-time point deep image representations with clinical data, including tumor subtypes, was developed to predict pCR. The performance of the model was evaluated via the method of nested 5-fold cross validation. Moreover, we also quantified prediction uncertainty for each patient through test-time augmentation. To investigate the relationship between predictive performance and uncertainty, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was assessed on subgroups of patients stratified by the uncertainty score. Results: By integrating clinical data and DCEMR images obtained at three-time points before treatment completion, the AUROC reached 0.833 with a sensitivity of 0.723 and specificity of 0.800. This performance was significantly superior (p < 0.01) to models using only images (AUROC = 0.706) or only clinical data (AUROC = 0.746). After stratifying the patients into eight subgroups based on the uncertainty score, we found that group #1, with the lowest uncertainty, had a superior AUROC of 0.873. The AUROC decreased to 0.637 for group #8, which had the highest uncertainty. Conclusions: The results indicate that our convolutional LSTM network-based deep learning model can be used to predict pCR earlier before the completion of chemotherapy. By combining clinical data and multi-time point deep image representations, our model outperforms models built solely on clinical or image data. Estimating prediction uncertainty may enable physicians to prioritize or disregard predictions based on their associated uncertainties. This approach could potentially enhance the personalization of breast cancer therapy. © 2024 The Author(s).

  abstract={Background: The accurate evaluation of axillary lymph node (ALN) response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer holds great value. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence system utilising multiregional dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and clinicopathological characteristics to predict axillary pathological complete response (pCR) after NAC in breast cancer. Methods: This study included retrospective and prospective datasets from six medical centres in China between May 2018 and December 2023. A fully automated integrated system based on deep learning (FAIS-DL) was built to perform tumour and ALN segmentation and axillary pCR prediction sequentially. The predictive performance of FAIS-DL was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RNA sequencing analysis were conducted on 45 patients to explore the biological basis of FAIS-DL. Findings: 1145 patients (mean age, 50 years ±10 [SD]) were evaluated. Among these patients, 506 were in the training and validation sets (axillary pCR rate of 40.3%), 127 in the internal test set (axillary pCR rate of 37.8%), 414 in the pooled external test set (axillary pCR rate of 48.8%), and 98 in the prospective test set (axillary pCR rate of 43.9%). For predicting axillary pCR, FAIS-DL achieved AUCs of 0.95, 0.93, and 0.94 in the internal test set, pooled external test set, and prospective test set, respectively, which were also significantly higher than those of the clinical model and deep learning models based on single-regional DCE-MRI (all P < 0.05, DeLong test). In the pooled external and prospective test sets, the FAIS-DL decreased the unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection rate from 47.9% to 6.8%, and increased the benefit rate from 52.2% to 86.5%. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that high FAIS-DL scores were associated with the upregulation of immune-mediated genes and pathways. Interpretation: FAIS-DL has demonstrated satisfactory performance in predicting axillary pCR, which may guide the formulation of personalised treatment regimens for patients with breast cancer in clinical practice.

  abstract={We investigate the predictive value of a comprehensive model based on preoperative ultrasound radiomics, deep learning, and clinical features for pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for the breast cancer. We enrolled 155 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer who underwent NAC. The patients were randomly divided into the training set and the validation set in the ratio of 7:3. The deep learning and radiomics features of pre-treatment ultrasound images were extracted, and the random forest recursive elimination algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used for feature screening and DL-Score and Rad-Score construction. According to multifactorial logistic regression, independent clinical predictors, DL-Score, and Rad-Score were selected to construct the comprehensive prediction model DLRC. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of its predictive effect, and clinical practicability. Compared to the clinical, radiomics (Rad-Score), and deep learning (DL-Score) models, the DLRC accurately predicted the pCR status, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.937 (95%CI: 0.895–0.970) in the training set and 0.914 (95%CI: 0.838–0.973) in the validation set. Moreover, decision curve analysis confirmed that the DLRC had the highest clinical value among all models. The comprehensive model DLRC based on ultrasound radiomics, deep learning, and clinical features can effectively and accurately predict the pCR status of breast cancer after NAC, which is conducive to assisting clinical personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. © The Author(s) 2024.},

  abstract={Early prediction of treatment response can facilitate personalized treatment for breast cancer patients. Studies on the I-SPY 2 clinical trial demonstrate that multi-time point dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCEMR) imaging improves the accuracy of predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to chemotherapy. However, previous image-based prediction models usually rely on mid- or post-treatment images to ensure the accuracy of prediction, which may outweigh the benefit of response-based adaptive treatment strategy. Accurately predicting the pCR at the early time point is desired yet remains challenging. To improve prediction accuracy at the early time point of treatment, we proposed a two-stage dual-task learning strategy to train a deep neural network for early prediction using only early-treatment data. We developed and evaluated our proposed method using the I-SPY 2 dataset, which included DCEMR images acquired at three time points: pretreatment (T0), after 3 weeks (T1) and 12 weeks of treatment (T2). At the first stage, we trained a convolutional long short-term memory model using all the data to predict pCR and extract the latent space image representation at T2. At the second stage, we trained a dual-task model to simultaneously predict pCR and the image representation at T2 using images from T0 and T1. This allowed us to predict pCR earlier without using images from T2. By using the conventional single-stage single-task strategy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.799. By using the proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy, the AUROC was improved to 0.820. Our proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy can improve model performance significantly (p = 0.0025) for predicting pCR at the early time point (3rd week) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer patients. The early prediction model can potentially help physicians to intervene early and develop personalized plans at the early stage of chemotherapy.

  abstract={Purpose: Build machine learning (ML) models able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer (BC) patients based on conventional and radiomic signatures extracted from baseline [18F]FDG PET/CT. Material and methods: Primary tumor and the most significant lymph node metastasis were manually segmented in baseline [18F]FDG PET/CT of 52 newly diagnosed BC patients. Clinical parameters, NAC and conventional semiquantitative PET parameters were collected. The standard of reference considered was surgical pCR after NAC (ypT0;ypN0). Eight-hundred-fifty-four radiomic features (RFts) were extracted from both PET and CT datasets, according to IBSI; robust RFTs were selected. The cohort was split in training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Four ML Models (Clinical Model, CT Model, PET Model_T and PET Model_T + N) each one with 3 learners (Random Forest (RF), Neural Network and Stochastic Gradient Descendent) were trained and tested using RFts and clinical signatures. PET Models were built considering robust RFTs extracted from either primary tumor alone (PET Model_T) or also including the reference lymph node (PET Model_T + N). Results: 72 pathological uptakes (52 primary BC and 20 lymph node metastasis) at [18F]FDG PET/CT were segmented. pCR occurred in 44.2% cases. Twelve, 46 and 141 robust RFts were selected from CT Model, PET Model_T and PET Model_T + N, respectively. PET Models showed better performance than CT and Clinical Models. The best performances were obtained by the RF algorithm of the PET Model_T + N (AUC = 0.83;CA = 0.74;TP = 78%;TN = 72%). Conclusion: ML models trained on PET/CT radiomic features extracted from primary BC and lymph node metastasis could concur in the prediction of pCR after NAC and improve BC management. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={This study proposes a dual-temporal feature fusion model based on a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to achieve early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. By constructing a treatment response simulator, the model utilizes cGAN to generate individualized virtual post-treatment ultrasound imaging features and integrates multi-scale features from pre- and post-treatment phases through spatiotemporal alignment and information complementarity. Experiments involving ultrasound imaging data from 171 breast cancer patients demonstrated that the model achieved an AUC of 0.873 on the test set, with sensitivity and specificity of 70.0% and 90.6%, respectively, outperforming traditional single-time-point models. The method advances the therapeutic response prediction window by 4–6 weeks through feature generation technology and employs a dual-path ResNet architecture to hierarchically fuse tumor heterogeneity features, significantly improving computational efficiency compared to conventional approaches. This research overcomes the limitations of static radiomics by providing a novel decision-support tool for clinical personalized treatment planning, though further validation through multicenter data is required to confirm the model's generalizability. © 2025 IEEE.},

  abstract={Purpose: To evaluate if a machine learning prediction model based on clinical and easily assessable imaging features derived from baseline breast [18F]FDG-PET/MRI staging can predict pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer prior to neoadjuvant system therapy (NAST). Methods: Altogether 143 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer (54 ± 12 years) were retrospectively enrolled. All women underwent a breast [18F]FDG-PET/MRI, a histopathological workup of their breast cancer lesions and evaluation of clinical data. Fifty-six features derived from positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sociodemographic / anthropometric, histopathologic as well as clinical data were generated and used as input for an extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost) to predict pCR. The model was evaluated in a five-fold nested-cross-validation incorporating independent hyper-parameter tuning within the inner loops to reduce the risk of overoptimistic estimations. Diagnostic model-performance was assessed by determining the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. Furthermore, feature importances of the XGBoost model were evaluated to assess which features contributed most to distinguish between pCR and non-pCR. Results: Nested-cross-validation yielded a mean ROC-AUC of 80.4 ± 6.0% for prediction of pCR. Mean sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 54.5 ± 21.3%, 83.6 ± 4.2%, 63.6 ± 8.5%, and 77.6 ± 8.1% could be achieved. Histopathological data were the most important features for classification of the XGBoost model followed by PET, MRI, and sociodemographic/anthropometric features. Conclusion: The evaluated multi-source XGBoost model shows promising results for reliably predicting pathological complete response in breast cancer patients prior to NAST. However, yielded performance is yet insufficient to be implemented in the clinical decision-making process. © The Author(s) 2023.},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: To construct and validate a clinical-radiomics model based on radiomics features extracted from two-stage multimodal ultrasound and clinicopathologic information for early predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients treated with NAC. Materials and Methods: Consecutive women with biopsy-proven breast cancer undergoing multimodal US pretreatment and after two cycles of NAC and followed by surgery between January 2014 and November 2023 were retrospectively collected for clinical-radiomics model construction (n = 274) and retrospective test (n = 134). The predictive performance of it was further tested in a subsequent prospective internal test set recruited between January 2024 to July 2024 (n = 76). Finally, a total of 484 patients were enrolled. The clinical-radiomics model predictive performance was compared with radiomics model, clinical model and radiologists’ visual assessment by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis and DeLong test. Results: The proposed clinical-radiomics model obtained the AUC values of 0.92 (95%CI: 0.88, 0.94) and 0.85 (95%CI: 0.79, 0.89) in retrospective and prospective test sets, respectively, which were significantly higher than that those of the radiomics model (AUCs: 0.75–0.85), clinical model (AUCs: 0.68–0.72) and radiologists’ visual assessments (AUCs:0.59–0.68) (all p < 0.05). In addition, the predictive efficacy of the radiologists was improved under the assistance of the clinical-radiomics model significantly. Conclusion: The clinical-radiomics model developed in this study, which integrated clinicopathologic information and two-stage multimodal ultrasound features, was able to early predict pCR to NAC in breast cancer patients with favorable predictive effectiveness. © 2025},

  abstract={Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) improves surgical outcomes for breast cancer patients, with pathologic complete response (pCR) correlated with enhanced survival. The role of radiomics, particularly from peritumoral tissue, in predicting pCR remains under investigation. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed radiomic features from pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans of 150 patients undergoing NACT. A proportional approach was used to define peritumoral zones, assessed both with a 10% and 30% extension, allowing more standardized assessments relative to the tumor size. Radiomic features were evaluated alongside clinical and biological data to predict pCR. The association of clinical/biological and radiomic features with pCR to NACT was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis, logistic regression, and a random forest model. A clinical/biological model, a radiomic model, and a combined clinical/biological and 4 radiomic models for predicting the response to NACT were constructed. Area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the performance of the models. Results: Ninety-five patients (average age 47 years) were finally included. HER2 +, basal-like molecular subtypes, and a high level of Ki67 (≥ 20%) were associated with a higher likelihood of pCR to NACT. The combined clinical–biological–radiomic model, especially with a 10% peritumoral extension, showed improved predictive accuracy (AUC 0.76, CI 0.65–0.85) compared to models using clinical–biological data alone (AUC 0.73, CI 0.63–0.83). Conclusions: Integrating peritumoral radiomic features with clinical and biological data enhances the prediction of pCR to NACT, underscoring the potential of a multifaceted approach in treatment personalization. © Italian Society of Medical Radiology 2025.},

  abstract={Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard treatment for early-stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The primary endpoint of NAC is a pathological complete response (pCR). NAC results in pCR in only 30–40% of TNBC patients. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), Ki67 and phosphohistone H3 (pH3) are a few known biomarkers to predict NAC response. Currently, systematic evaluation of the combined value of these biomarkers in predicting NAC response is lacking. In this study, the predictive value of markers derived from H&E and IHC stained biopsy tissue was comprehensively evaluated using a supervised machine learning (ML)-based approach. Identifying predictive biomarkers could help guide therapeutic decisions by enabling precise stratification of TNBC patients into responders and partial or non-responders. Methods: Serial sections from core needle biopsies (n = 76) were stained with H&E and immunohistochemically for the Ki67 and pH3 markers, followed by whole-slide image (WSI) generation. The serial section stains in H&E stain, Ki67 and pH3 markers formed WSI triplets for each patient. The resulting WSI triplets were co-registered with H&E WSIs serving as the reference. Separate mask region-based CNN (MRCNN) models were trained with annotated H&E, Ki67 and pH3 images for detecting tumor cells, stromal and intratumoral TILs (sTILs and tTILs), Ki67+, and pH3+ cells. Top image patches with a high density of cells of interest were identified as hotspots. Best classifiers for NAC response prediction were identified by training multiple ML models and evaluating their performance by accuracy, area under curve, and confusion matrix analyses. Results: Highest prediction accuracy was achieved when hotspot regions were identified by tTIL counts and each hotspot was represented by measures of tTILs, sTILs, tumor cells, Ki67+, and pH3+ features. Regardless of the hotspot selection metric, a complementary use of multiple histological features (tTILs, sTILs) and molecular biomarkers (Ki67 and pH3) resulted in top ranked performance at the patient level. Conclusions: Overall, our results emphasize that prediction models for NAC response should be based on biomarkers in combination rather than in isolation. Our study provides compelling evidence to support the use of ML-based models to predict NAC response in patients with TNBC. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={PURPOSE Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used in breast cancer. Predictive modeling is useful in predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to NAC. We test machine learning (ML) models to predict pCR in breast cancer and explore methods of handling missing data. METHODS Four hundred and ninety-nine patients with breast cancer treated with NAC in two centers in Singapore (National Cancer Centre Singapore [NCCS] and KK Hospital) between January 2014 and December 2017 were included. Eleven clinical features were used to train five different ML models. Listwise deletion and imputation were evaluated on handling missing data. Model performance was evaluated by AUC and calibration (Brier score). Feature importance from the best performing model in the external testing data set was calculated using Shapley additive explanations. RESULTS Seventy-two (24.6%), 18 (24.7%), and 31 (24.8%) patients attained pCR in NCCS training, NCCS testing, and KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) testing data sets, respectively. The random forest (RF) base and imputed models have the highest AUCs in the KKH cohort of 0.794 (95% CI, 0.709 to 0.873) and 0.795 (95% CI, 0.706 to 0.871), respectively, and were the best calibrated with the lowest Brier score. No statistically significant difference was noted between AUCs of the base and imputed models in all data sets. The imputed model had a larger positive predictive value (PPV; 98.2% v 95.1%) and negative predictive value (NPV; 96.7% v 90.0%) than the base model in the KKH data set. Estrogen receptor intensity, human epidermal growth factor 2 intensity, and age at diagnosis were the three most important predictors. CONCLUSION ML, particularly RF, demonstrates reasonable accuracy in pCR prediction after NAC. Imputing missing fields in the data can improve the PPV and NPV of the pCR prediction model. © 2024 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

  abstract={Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the primary treatment used to reduce the tumor size in early breast cancer. Patients who achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) after NAC treatment have a significantly higher five-year survival rate. However, accurately predicting whether patients could achieve pCR remains challenging due to the limited availability of manually annotated MRI data. This study develops a weakly and semi-supervised joint learning model that integrates multi-parametric MR images to predict pCR to NAC in breast cancer patients. First, the attention-based multi-instance learning model is designed to characterize the representation of multi-parametric MR images in a weakly supervised learning setting. The Mean-Teacher learning framework is then developed to locate tumor regions for extracting radiochemical parameters in a semi-supervised learning setting. Finally, all extracted MR imaging features are fused to predict pCR to NAC. Our experiments were conducted on a cohort of 442 patients with multi-parametric MR images and NAC outcomes. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, which leverages multi-parametric MRI data, provides the AUC value of over 0.85 in predicting pCR to NAC, outperforming other comparative methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Current approaches to breast cancer therapy include neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). The efficacy of NST is measured by pathologic complete response (pCR). A patient who attains pCR has significantly enhanced disease-free survival progress. The accurate prediction of pCR in response to a given treatment regimen could increase the likelihood of achieving pCR and prevent toxicities caused by treatments that are not effective. Th early prediction of response to NST can increase the likelihood of survival and help with decisions regarding breast-conserving surgery. An automated NST prediction framework that is able to precisely predict which patient undergoing NST will achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) at an early stage of treatment is needed. Here, we propose an end-to-end efficient multimodal spatiotemporal deep learning framework (deep-NST) framework to predict the outcome of NST prior or at an early stage of treatment. The deep-NST model incorporates imaging data captured at different timestamps of NST regimens, a tumor’s molecular data, and a patient’s demographic data. The efficacy of the proposed work is validated on the publicly available ISPY-1 dataset, in terms of accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and computational complexity. In addition, seven ablation experiments were carried out to evaluate the impact of each design module in the proposed work. The experimental results show that the proposed framework performs significantly better than other recent methods. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is a challenging task clinically as it requires understanding complex histology interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information, but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning, which typically analyze small, isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients, we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs, constructs a spatial TME graph, and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy, 96.0% sensitivity, 88.0% specificity, and an AUC of 0.82, through eight-fold cross-validation, outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response, thereby helping to prevent overtreatment, improve patient quality of life, reduce treatment cost, and enhance clinical outcomes, marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Purpose Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a breast cancer subtype that has poor prognosis and exhibits a unique tumor microenvironment. Analysis of the tumor microbiome has indicated a relationship between the tumor microenvironment and treatment response. Therefore, we attempted to reveal the role of the tumor microbiome in patients with TNBC receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Materials and Methods We collected TNBC patient RNA-sequencing samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus and extracted microbiome count data. Differential and relative abundance were estimated with linear discriminant analysis effect size. We calculated the immune cell fraction with CIBERSORTx and conducted survival analysis using the Cancer Genome Atlas patient data. Correlations between the microbiome and immune cell compositions were analyzed and a prediction model was constructed to estimate drug response. Results Among the pathological complete response group (pCR), the beta diversity varied considerably; consequently, 20 genera and 24 species were observed to express a significant differential and relative abundance. Pandoraea pulmonicola and Brucella melitensis were found to be important features in determining drug response. In correlation analysis, Geosporobacter ferrireducens, Streptococcus sanguinis, and resting natural killer cells were the most correlated factors in the pCR, whereas Nitrosospira briensis, Plantactinospora sp. BC1, and regulatory T cells were key features in the residual disease group. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the microbiome analysis of tumor tissue can predict chemotherapy response of patients with TNBC. Further, the immunological tumor microenvironment may be impacted by the tumor microbiome, thereby affecting the corresponding survival and treatment response. © 2024 by the Korean Cancer Association.},

  abstract={Background: Breast cancer is highly heterogeneous, resulting in different treatment responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) among patients. A noninvasive quantitative measure of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) may be valuable for predicting treatment response. Purpose: To develop a quantitative measure of ITH on pretreatment MRI scans and test its performance for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAC in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Pretreatment MRI scans were retrospectively acquired in patients with breast cancer who received NAC followed by surgery at multiple centers from January 2000 to September 2020. Conventional radiomics (hereafter, C-radiomics) and intratumoral ecological diversity features were extracted from the MRI scans, and output probabilities of imaging-based decision tree models were used to generate a C-radiomics score and ITH index. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with pCR, and significant variables, including clinicopathologic variables, C-radiomics score, and ITH index, were combined into a predictive model for which performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The training data set was comprised of 335 patients (median age, 48 years [IQR, 42-54 years]) from centers A and B, and 590, 280, and 384 patients (median age, 48 years [IQR, 41-55 years]) were included in the three external test data sets. Molecular subtype (odds ratio [OR] range, 4.76-8.39 [95% CI: 1.79, 24.21]; all P < .01), ITH index (OR, 30.05 [95% CI: 8.43, 122.64]; P < .001), and C-radiomics score (OR, 29.90 [95% CI: 12.04, 81.70]; P < .001) were independently associated with the odds of achieving pCR. The combined model showed good performance for predicting pCR to NAC in the training data set (AUC, 0.90) and external test data sets (AUC range, 0.83-0.87). Conclusion: A model that combined an index created from pretreatment MRI-based imaging features quantitating ITH, C-radiomics score, and clinicopathologic variables showed good performance for predicting pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer. © 2023 Radiological Society of North America Inc..

  abstract={Background. Machine learning classifiers are increasingly used to create predictive models for pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Few studies have compared the effectiveness of different ML classifiers. This study evaluated radiomics models based on pre- and post-contrast first-phase T1 weighted images (T1WI) in predicting breast cancer pCR after NAT and compared the performance of ML classifiers. Methods. This retrospective study enrolled 281 patients undergoing NAT from the Duke-Breast-Cancer-MRI dataset. Radiomic features were extracted from pre- and post-contrast first-phase T1WI images. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, then the dataset was randomly divided into training and validation groups (7:3). The radiomics model was built using selected optimal features. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) were classifiers. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess predictive performance. Results. LightGBM performed best in predicting pCR [area under the curve (AUC): 0.823, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.743–0.902], accuracy 74.0%, sensitivity 85.0%, specificity 67.2%]. During subgroup analysis, RF was most effective in pCR prediction in luminal breast cancers (AUC: 0.914, 95% CI [0.847–0.981], accuracy 87.0%, sensitivity 85.2%, specificity 88.1%). In triple-negative breast cancers, LightGBM performed best (AUC: 0.836, 95% CI [0.708–0.965], accuracy 78.6%, sensitivity 68.2%, specificity 90.0%). Conclusion. The LightGBM-based radiomics model performed best in predicting pCR in patients with breast cancer. RF and LightGBM showed promising results for luminal and triple-negative breast cancers, respectively. © 2024 Li et al.},

  abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning radiomics (DLR) model based on longitudinal ultrasound data and clinical features to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients. Methods: Between January 2018 and June 2023, 312 patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned to a training cohort (n = 219) and a test cohort (n = 93) in a 7:3 ratio. Next, pre-NAC and post-treatment 2-cycle ultrasound images were collected, and radiomics and deep learning features were extracted from NAC pre-treatment (Pre), post-treatment 2 cycle (Post), and Delta (pre-NAC—NAC 2 cycle) images. In the training cohort, to filter features, the intraclass correlation coefficient test, the Boruta algorithm, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression were used. Single-modality models (Pre, Post, and Delta) were constructed based on five machine-learning classifiers. Finally, based on the classifier with the optimal predictive performance, the DLR model was constructed by combining Pre, Post, and Delta ultrasound features and was subsequently combined with clinical features to develop a combined model (Integrated). The discriminative power, predictive performance, and clinical utility of the models were further evaluated in the test cohort. Furthermore, patients were assigned into three subgroups, including the HR+/HER2-, HER2+, and TNBC subgroups, according to molecular typing to validate the predictability of the model across the different subgroups. Results: After feature screening, 16, 13, and 10 features were selected to construct the Pre model, Post model, and Delta model based on the five machine learning classifiers, respectively. The three single-modality models based on the XGBoost classifier displayed optimal predictive performance. Meanwhile, the DLR model (AUC of 0.827) was superior to the single-modality model (Pre, Post, and Delta AUCs of 0.726, 0.776, and 0.710, respectively) in terms of prediction performance. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis identified Her-2 status and histological grade as independent risk factors for NAC response in breast cancer. In both the training and test cohorts, the Integrated model, which included Pre, Post, and Delta ultrasound features and clinical features, exhibited the highest predictive ability, with AUC values of 0.924 and 0.875, respectively. Likewise, the Integrated model displayed the highest predictive performance across the different subgroups. Conclusion: The Integrated model, which incorporated pre-NAC treatment and early treatment ultrasound data and clinical features, accurately predicted pCR after NAC in breast cancer patients and provided valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies, allowing for timely adjustment of chemotherapy regimens. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={Breast cancers are complex ecosystems of malignant cells and the tumour microenvironment1. The composition of these tumour ecosystems and interactions within them contribute to responses to cytotoxic therapy2. Efforts to build response predictors have not incorporated this knowledge. We collected clinical, digital pathology, genomic and transcriptomic profiles of pre-treatment biopsies of breast tumours from 168 patients treated with chemotherapy with or without HER2 (encoded by ERBB2)-targeted therapy before surgery. Pathology end points (complete response or residual disease) at surgery3 were then correlated with multi-omic features in these diagnostic biopsies. Here we show that response to treatment is modulated by the pre-treated tumour ecosystem, and its multi-omics landscape can be integrated in predictive models using machine learning. The degree of residual disease following therapy is monotonically associated with pre-therapy features, including tumour mutational and copy number landscapes, tumour proliferation, immune infiltration and T cell dysfunction and exclusion. Combining these features into a multi-omic machine learning model predicted a pathological complete response in an external validation cohort (75 patients) with an area under the curve of 0.87. In conclusion, response to therapy is determined by the baseline characteristics of the totality of the tumour ecosystem captured through data integration and machine learning. This approach could be used to develop predictors for other cancers. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={PURPOSE The optimal characteristics among patients with breast cancer to recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an active area of clinical research. We developed and compared several approaches to developing prediction models for pathologic complete response (pCR) among patients with breast cancer in Alberta. METHODS The study included all patients with breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Alberta between 2012 and 2014 identified from the Alberta Cancer Registry. Patient, tumor, and treatment data were obtained through primary chart review. pCR was defined as no residual invasive tumor at surgical excision in breast or axilla. Two types of prediction models for pCR were built: (1) expert model: variables selected on the basis of oncologists’ opinions and (2) data-driven model: variables selected by trained machine. These model types were fit using logistic regression (LR), random forests (RF), and gradient-boosted trees (GBT). We compared the models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and integrated calibration index, and internally validated using bootstrap resampling. RESULTS A total of 363 cases were included in the analyses, of which 86 experienced pCR. The RF and GBT fits yielded higher optimism-corrected area under the receiver operating characteristic curves compared with LR for the expert (RF: 0.70; GBT: 0.69; LR: 0.65) and data-driven models (RF: 0.71; GBT: 0.68; LR: 0.64). The LR fit yielded the lowest integrated calibration indices for the expert (LR: 0.037; GBT: 0.05; RF: 0.10) and data-driven models (LR: 0.026; GBT: 0.06; RF: 0.099). CONCLUSION Our models demonstrated predictive ability for pCR using routinely collected clinical and demographic variables. We show that machine learning fit methods can be used to optimize models for pCR prediction. We also show that additional variables beyond clinical expertise do not considerably improve predictive ability and may not be of value on the basis of the burden of data collection. © 2022 by American Society of Clinical Oncology},

  abstract={Objectives: We aimed to determine whether radiomic features extracted from a highly homogeneous database of breast MRI could non-invasively predict pathological complete responses (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with breast cancer. Methods: One hundred patients with breast cancer receiving NACT in a single center (01/2017–06/2019) and undergoing breast MRI were retrospectively evaluated. For each patient, radiomic features were extracted within the biopsy-proven tumor on T1-weighted (T1-w) contrast-enhanced MRI performed before NACT. The pCR to NACT was determined based on the final surgical specimen. The association of clinical/biological and radiomic features with response to NACT was evaluated by univariate and multivariable analysis by using random forest and logistic regression. The performances of all models were assessed using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Eighty-three patients (mean (SD) age, 47.26 (8.6) years) were included. Patients with HER2+, basal-like molecular subtypes and Ki67 ≥ 20% presented a pCR to NACT more frequently; the clinical/biological model’s AUC (95% CI) was 0.81 (0.71–0.90). Using 136 representative radiomics features selected through cluster analysis from the 1037 extracted features, a radiomic score was calculated to predict the response to NACT, with AUC (95% CI): 0.64 (0.51–0.75). After combining the clinical/biological and radiomics models, the AUC (95% CI) was 0.83 (0.73–0.92). Conclusions: MRI-based radiomic features slightly improved the pre-treatment prediction of pCR to NACT, in addiction to biological characteristics. If confirmed on larger cohorts, it could be helpful to identify such patients, to avoid unnecessary treatment. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Background: To assess the value of radiomics based on multiphases contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) for early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in patients with human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive invasive breast cancer. Methods: A total of 127 patients with newly diagnosed primary HER2 positive invasive breast cancer underwent CE-MRI before NAT and performed surgery after NAT. Radiomic features were extracted from the 1st postcontrast CE-MRI phase (CEi) and multi-phases CE- MRI (CEm),respectively. With selected features using a forward stepwise regression, 23 machine learning classifiers based on CE1 and CEm were constructed respectively for differentiating pCR and non-pCR patients. The performances of classifiers were assessed and compared by their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC (area under curve). The optimal machine learning classification was used to discriminate pCR vs non-pCR in mass and non-mass groups, uni-focal and unilateral multi-focal groups, respectively. Results: For the task of pCR classification, 6 radiomic features from CE1 and 6 from CEm were selected for the construction of machine learning models, respectively. The linear SVM based on CEm outperformed the logistic regression model using CE1 with an AUC of 0.84 versus 0.69. In mass and non-mass enhancement groups, the accuracy of linear SVM achieved 84% and 76%. Whereas in unifocal and unilateral multifocal cases, 79% and 75% accuracy were achieved by linear SVM. Conclusion: Multiphases CE-MRI imaging may offer more heterogeneity information in the tumor and provide a non-invasive approach for early prediction of pCR to NAT in patients with HER2-positive invasive breast cancer. © 2021 Li et al.},

  abstract={Objective The objective of this study was to develop a nomogrom for prediction of pathological complete response (PCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Methods Ninety-one patients were analyzed. A total of 396 radiomics features were extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was selected for data dimension reduction to build a radiomics signature. Finally, the nomogram was built to predict PCR. Results The radiomics signature of the model that combined DCE-MRI and ADC maps showed a higher performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.848) than the models with DCE-MRI (AUC, 0.750) or ADC maps (AUC, 0.785) alone in the training set. The proposed model, which included combined radiomics signature, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor, yielded a maximum AUC of 0.837 in the testing set. Conclusions The combined radiomics features from DCE-MRI and ADC data may serve as potential predictor markers for predicting PCR. The nomogram could be used as a quantitative tool to predict PCR.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Background: Early prediction of treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer can facilitate timely adjustment of treatment regimens. We aimed to develop and validate a Siamese multi-task network (SMTN) for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) based on longitudinal ultrasound images at the early stage of NACT. Methods: In this multicentre, retrospective cohort study, a total of 393 patients with biopsy-proven HER2-positive breast cancer were retrospectively enrolled from three hospitals in china between December 16, 2013 and March 05, 2021, and allocated into a training cohort and two external validation cohorts. Patients receiving full cycles of NACT and with surgical pathological results available were eligible for inclusion. The key exclusion criteria were missing ultrasound images and/or clinicopathological characteristics. The proposed SMTN consists of two subnetworks that could be joined at multiple layers, which allowed for the integration of multi-scale features and extraction of dynamic information from longitudinal ultrasound images before and after the first /second cycles of NACT. We constructed the clinical model as a baseline using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Then the performance of SMTN was evaluated and compared with the clinical model. Findings: The training cohort, comprising 215 patients, were selected from Yunnan Cancer Hospital. The two independent external validation cohorts, comprising 95 and 83 patients, were selected from Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, and Shanxi Cancer Hospital, respectively. The SMTN yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.986 (95% CI: 0.977–0.995), 0.902 (95%CI: 0.856–0.948), and 0.957 (95%CI: 0.924–0.990) in the training cohort and two external validation cohorts, respectively, which were significantly higher than that those of the clinical model (AUC: 0.524–0.588, Pall < 0.05). The AUCs values of the SMTN within the anti-HER2 therapy subgroups were 0.833-0.972 in the two external validation cohorts. Moreover, 272 of 279 (97.5%) non-pCR patients (159 of 160 (99.4%), 53 of 54 (98.1%), and 60 of 65 (92.3%) in the training and two external validation cohorts, respectively) were successfully identified by the SMTN, suggesting that they could benefit from regime adjustment at the early-stage of NACT. Interpretation: The SMTN was able to predict pCR in the early-stage of NACT for HER2-positive breast cancer patients, which could guide clinicians in adjusting treatment regimes.

  abstract={The achievement of the pathologic complete response (pCR) has been considered a metric for the success of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and a powerful surrogate indicator of the risk of recurrence and long-term survival. This study aimed to develop a multimodal deep learning model that combined clinical information and pretreatment MR images for predicting pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer. The retrospective study cohort consisted of 536 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent pre-operative NAC. We developed a deep learning model to fuse high-dimensional MR image features and the clinical information for the pretreatment prediction of pCR to NAC in breast cancer. The proposed deep learning model trained on all datasets as clinical information, T1-weighted subtraction images, and T2-weighted images shows better performance with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.888 as compared to the model using only clinical information (AUC = 0.827, P < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that the multimodal fusion approach using deep learning with both clinical information and MR images achieve higher prediction performance compared to the deep learning model without the fusion approach. Deep learning could integrate pretreatment MR images with clinical information to improve pCR prediction performance. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Introduction: The purpose of this study was to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer using radiomics based on pretreatment staging contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). Patients and Methods: A total of 215 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Based on the intratumoral and peritumoral regions of CECT images, radiomic features were extracted and selected, respectively, to develop an intratumoral signature and a peritumoral signature with logistic regression in a training dataset (138 patients from November 2015 to October 2017). We also developed a clinical model with the molecular characterization of the tumor. A radiomic nomogram was further constructed by incorporating the intratumoral and peritumoral signatures with molecular characterization. The performance of the nomogram was validated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility in an independent validation dataset (77 patients from November 2017 to December 2018). Stratified analysis was performed to develop a subtype-specific radiomic signature for each subgroup. Results: Compared with the clinical model (area under the curve [AUC], 0.756), the radiomic nomogram (AUC, 0.818) achieved better performance for pCR prediction in the validation dataset with continuous net reclassification improvement of 0.787 and good calibration. Decision curve analysis suggested the nomogram was clinically useful. Subtype-specific radiomic signatures showed improved AUCs (luminal subgroup, 0.936; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive subgroup, 0.825; and triple negative subgroup, 0.858) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: This study has revealed a predictive value of pretreatment staging-CECT and successfully developed and validated a radiomic nomogram for individualized prediction of pCR to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer, which could assist clinical decision-making and improve patient outcome. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Background: The aim of this study was to assess whether multiparametric18F-FDG PET/MRI-based radiomics analysis is able to predict pathological complete response in breast cancer patients and hence potentially enhance pretherapeutic patient stratification. Methods: A total of 73 female patients (mean age 49 years; range 27–77 years) with newly diagnosed, therapy-naive breast cancer underwent simultaneous18F-FDG PET/MRI and were included in this retrospective study. All PET/MRI datasets were imported to dedicated software (ITK-SNAP v. 3.6.0) for lesion annotation using a semi-automated method. Pretreatment biopsy specimens were used to determine tumor histology, tumor and nuclear grades, and immunohistochemical status. Histopathological results from surgical tumor specimens were used as the reference standard to distinguish between complete pathological response (pCR) and noncomplete pathological response. An elastic net was employed to select the most important radiomic features prior to model development. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated for each model. Results: The best results in terms of AUCs and NPV for predicting complete pathological response in the entire cohort were obtained by the combination of all MR sequences and PET (0.8 and 79.5%, respectively), and no significant differences from the other models were observed. In further subgroup analyses, combining all MR and PET data, the best AUC (0.94) for predicting complete pathologic response was obtained in the HR+/HER2− group. No difference between results with/without the inclusion of PET characteristics was observed in the TN/HER2+ group, each leading to an AUC of 0.92 for all MR and all MR + PET datasets. Conclusion:18F-FDG PET/MRI enables comprehensive high-quality radiomics analysis for the prediction of pCR in breast cancer patients, especially in those with HR+/HER2− receptor status. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract={Background: For breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), pathologic complete response (pCR; no invasive or in situ) cannot be assessed non-invasively so all patients undergo surgery. The aim of our study was to develop and validate a radiomics classifier that classifies breast cancer pCR post-NAC on MRI prior to surgery. Methods: This retrospective study included women treated with NAC for breast cancer from 2014 to 2016 with (1) pre- and post-NAC breast MRI and (2) post-NAC surgical pathology report assessing response. Automated radiomics analysis of pre- and post-NAC breast MRI involved image segmentation, radiomics feature extraction, feature pre-filtering, and classifier building through recursive feature elimination random forest (RFE-RF) machine learning. The RFE-RF classifier was trained with nested five-fold cross-validation using (a) radiomics only (model 1) and (b) radiomics and molecular subtype (model 2). Class imbalance was addressed using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Results: Two hundred seventy-three women with 278 invasive breast cancers were included; the training set consisted of 222 cancers (61 pCR, 161 no-pCR; mean age 51.8 years, SD 11.8), and the independent test set consisted of 56 cancers (13 pCR, 43 no-pCR; mean age 51.3 years, SD 11.8). There was no significant difference in pCR or molecular subtype between the training and test sets. Model 1 achieved a cross-validation AUROC of 0.72 (95% CI 0.64, 0.79) and a similarly accurate (P = 0.1) AUROC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.71, 0.94) in both the training and test sets. Model 2 achieved a cross-validation AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.72, 0.87) and a similar (P = 0.9) AUROC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.62, 0.94) in both the training and test sets.

  abstract={Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of radiomics signature-derived 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) for the early prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) outcomes in patients with (BC). Methods: A total of 124 patients with BC who underwent pretreatment PET-CT scanning and received NAC between December 2016 and August 2019 were studied. The dataset was randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to either the training or validation cohort. Primary tumor segmentation was performed, and radiomics signatures were extracted from each PET-derived volume of interest (VOI) and CT-derived VOI. Radiomics signatures associated with pathological treatment response were selected from within a training cohort (n = 85), which were then applied to generate different classifiers to predict the probability of pathological complete response (pCR). Different models were then independently tested in the validation cohort (n = 39) regarding their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Results: Thirty-five patients (28.2%) had pCR to NAC. Twelve features consisting of five PET-derived signatures, four CT-derived signatures, and three clinicopathological variables were candidates for the model’s development. The random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree (DT) classifiers were established, which could be utilized to predict pCR to NAC with AUC ranging from 0.819 to 0.849 in the validation cohort. Conclusions: The PET/CT-based radiomics analysis might provide efficient predictors of pCR in patients with BC, which could potentially be applied in clinical practice for individualized treatment strategy formulation.

  abstract={Background: Achieving pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) improves survival outcomes for breast cancer patients. Currently, conventional histopathological biomarkers predicting such responses are inconsistent. Studies investigating radiomic texture analysis from breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict pCR have varied radiomic protocols introducing heterogeneity between results. Thus, the efficacy of radiomic profiles compared to conventional strategies to predict pCR are inconclusive. Purpose: Comparing the predictive accuracy of different breast MRI radiomic protocols to identify the optimal strategy in predicting pCR to NAC. Material and methods: A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Four databases were searched up to October 4th, 2021. Nine predictive strategies were compared, including conventional biomarker parameters, MRI radiomic analysis conducted before, during, or after NAC, combination strategies and nomographic methodology. Results: 14 studies included radiomic data from 2,722 breast cancers, of which 994 were used in validation cohorts. All MRI derived radiomic features improved predictive accuracy when compared to biomarkers, except for pre-NAC MRI radiomics (odds ratio [OR]: 0.00; 95 % CI: −0.07–0.08). During-NAC and post-NAC MRI improved predictive accuracy compared to Pre-NAC MRI (OR: 0.14, 95 % CI: 0.02–0.26) and (OR: 0.26, 95 % CI: 0.07–0.45) respectively. Combining multiple MRIs did not improve predictive performance compared to Mid- or Post-NAC MRIs individually. Conclusion: Radiomic analysis of breast MRIs improve identification of patients likely to achieve a pCR to NAC. Post-NAC MRI are the most accurate imaging method to extrapolate radiomic data to predict pCR. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Purpose: This study aimed to identify patients with pathological complete response (pCR) and make better clinical decisions by constructing a preoperative predictive model based on tumoral and peritumoral volumes of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: This study investigated MRI before NAC in 448 patients with nonmetastatic invasive ductal breast cancer (Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, n = 362, training cohort; and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, n = 86, validation cohort). The tumoral and peritumoral volumes of interest (VOIs) were segmented and MRI features were extracted. The radiomic features were filtered via a random forest algorithm, and a supporting vector machine was used for modeling. The receiver operator characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to assess the performance of the radiomics-based classifiers. Results: For each MRI sequence, a total of 863 radiomic features were extracted and the top 30 features were selected for model construction. The radiomic classifiers of tumoral VOI and peritumoral VOI were both promising for predicting pCR, with AUCs of 0.96 and 0.97 in the training cohort and 0.89 and 0.78 in the validation cohort, respectively. The tumoral + peritumoral VOI radiomic model could further improve the predictive accuracy, with AUCs of 0.98 and 0.92 in the training and validation cohorts. Conclusions: The tumoral and peritumoral multiparametric MRI radiomics model can promisingly predict pCR in breast cancer using MRI images before surgery. Our results highlighted the potential value of the tumoral and peritumoral radiomic model in cancer management. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Purpose: To compare the performances of deep learning (DL) to radiomics analysis (RA) in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) based on pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in breast cancer. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 356 breast cancer patients who underwent DCE-MRI before NAC and underwent surgery after NAC. Image features and kinetic parameters of tumors were derived from DCE-MRI. Molecular information was assessed based on immunohistochemistry results. The image-based RA and DL models were constructed by adding kinetic parameters or molecular information to image-only linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The predictive performances of developed models were assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and compared with the DeLong method. Results: The overall pCR rate was 23.3% (83/356). The area under the ROC (AUROC) of the image-kinetic-molecular RA model was 0.781 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.735, 0.828], which was higher than that of the image-kinetic RA model (0.629, 95% CI: 0.595, 0.663; P < 0.001) and comparable to that of the image-molecular RA model (0.755, 95% CI: 0.708, 0.802; P = 0.133). The AUROC of the image-kinetic-molecular DL model was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.816, 0.847), which was higher than that of the image-kinetic and image-molecular DL models (0.707, 95% CI: 0.654, 0.761; 0.79, 95% CI: 0.768, 0.812; P < 0.001) and higher than that of the image-kinetic-molecular RA model (0.778, 95% CI: 0.735, 0.828; P < 0.001). Conclusions: The pretreatment DCE-MRI-based DL model is superior to the RA model in predicting pCR to NAC in breast cancer patients. The image-kinetic-molecular DL model has the best prediction performance. Copyright © 2022 Peng, Cheng, Gong, Zheng, Zhang, Wu, Yang, Yang, Zheng and Shen.},

  abstract={Purpose: Pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is commonly accepted as the gold standard to assess outcome after NAC in breast cancer patients. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has unique value in tumor staging, predicting prognosis, and evaluating treatment response. Our aim was to determine if we could identify radiomic predictors from PET/CT in breast cancer patient therapeutic efficacy prior to NAC. Methods: This retrospective study included 100 breast cancer patients who received NAC; there were 2210 PET/CT radiomic features extracted. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning models were used to identify the prognostic radiomic predictors through the following: (1) selection of the significant (p < 0.05) imaging features from consensus clustering and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test; (2) selection of the most discriminative features via univariate random forest (Uni-RF) and the Pearson correlation matrix (PCM); and (3) determination of the most predictive features from a traversal feature selection (TFS) based on a multivariate random forest (RF). The prediction model was constructed with RF and then validated with 10-fold cross-validation for 30 times and then independently validated. The performance of the radiomic predictors was measured in terms of area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Results: The PET/CT radiomic predictors achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.857 (AUC = 0.844) on the training split set and 0.767 (AUC = 0.722) on the independent validation set. When age was incorporated, the accuracy for the split set increased to 0.857 (AUC = 0.958) and 0.8 (AUC = 0.73) for the independent validation set and both outperformed the clinical prediction model. We also found a close association between the radiomic features, receptor expression, and tumor T stage. Conclusion: Radiomic predictors from pre-treatment PET/CT scans when combined with patient age were able to predict pCR after NAC. We suggest that these data will be valuable for patient management. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background: Pathological complete response (pCR) is considered a surrogate endpoint for favorable survival in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Predictive biomarkers of treatment response are crucial for guiding treatment decisions. With the hypothesis that histological information on tumor biopsy images could predict NAC response in breast cancer, we proposed a novel deep learning (DL)-based biomarker that predicts pCR from images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue and evaluated its predictive performance. Methods: In total, 540 breast cancer patients receiving standard NAC were enrolled. Based on H&E-stained images, DL methods were employed to automatically identify tumor epithelium and predict pCR by scoring the identified tumor epithelium to produce a histopathological biomarker, the pCR-score. The predictive performance of the pCR-score was assessed and compared with that of conventional biomarkers including stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) and subtype. Results: The pCR-score derived from H&E staining achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.847 in predicting pCR directly, and achieved accuracy, F1 score, and AUC of 0.853, 0.503, and 0.822 processed by the logistic regression method, respectively, higher than either sTILs or subtype; a prediction model of pCR constructed by integrating sTILs, subtype and pCR-score yielded a mean AUC of 0.890, outperforming the baseline sTIL-subtype model by 0.051 (0.839, P = 0.001). Conclusion: The DL-based pCR-score from histological images is predictive of pCR better than sTILs and subtype, and holds the great potentials for a more accurate stratification of patients for NAC. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Objective: To establish and validate a radiomics nomogram based on contrast-enhanced (CE)-MRI for predicting the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer with non-mass enhancement (NME). Methods: A cohort comprising 117 HER2-positive breast cancer patients showing NME on CE-MRI between January 2012 and December 2019 were retrospectively analysed in our study. Patients were classified as pathological complete respone (pCR) according to surgical specimens and axillary lymph nodes without invasive tumour cells. Clinicopathological data were recorded, and images were assessed by two radiologists. A total of 1130 radiomics features were extracted from the primary tumour and six radiomics features were selected by the maximal relevance and minimal redundancy and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithms. Univariate logistic regression was used to screen mean-ingful clinical and imaging features. The rad-score and independent risk factors were incorporated to build a nomogram model. Calibration and receiver operator characteristic curves were used to confirm the performance of the nomogram in the training and testing cohorts. The clinical usefulness of the nomogram was evaluated by decision curve analysis. Results: The difference in the rad-score between the pCR and non-pCR groups was significant in the training and testing cohorts (p < 0.01). The nomogram model showed good calibration and discrimination, with AUCs of 0.900 and 0.810 in the training and testing cohorts. Decision curve analysis indicated that the radiomics-based model was superior in terms of patient clinical benefit. Conclusion: The MRI-based radiomics nomogram model could be used to pre-operatively predict the efficacy of NAC in HER2-positive breast cancer patients showing NME. Advances in knowledge: HER2-positive breast cancer showing segmental enhancement on CE-MRI was more likely to achieve pCR after NAC than regional enhancement and diffuse enhancement. The MRI-based radiomics nomogram model could be used to pre-operatively predict the efficacy of NAC in HER2-positive breast cancer that showed NME. © 2022, British Institute of Radiology.

  abstract={Objective: To investigate the value of delta-radiomics after the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI for early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with breast cancer. Methods: From September 2018 to May 2021, a total of 140 consecutive patients (training, n = 98: validation, n = 42), newly diagnosed with breast cancer who received NAC before surgery, were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent DCE-MRI at pre-NAC (pre-) and after the first cycle (1st-) of NAC. Radiomic features were extracted from the postcontrast early, peak, and delay phases. Delta-radiomics features were computed in each contrast phases. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and a logistic regression model were used to select features and build models. The model performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and compared by DeLong test. Results: The delta-radiomics model based on the early phases of DCE-MRI showed a highest AUC (0.917/0.842 for training/validation cohort) compared with that using the peak and delay phases images. The delta-radiomics model outperformed the pre-radiomics model (AUC = 0.759/0.617, p = 0.011/0.047 for training/validation cohort) in early phase. Based on the optimal model, longitudinal fusion radiomic models achieved an AUC of 0.871/0.869 in training/validation cohort. Clinical-radiomics model generated good calibration and discrimination capacity with AUC 0.934 (95%CI: 0.882, 0.986)/0.864 (95%CI: 0.746, 0.982) for training and validation cohort. Delta-radiomics based on early contrast phases of DCE-MRI combined clinicopathology information could predict pCR after one cycle of NAC in patients with breast cancer. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of wavelet-transformed radiomic MRI in predicting the pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Methods: Fifty-five female patients with LABC who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) examination prior to NAC were collected for the retrospective study. According to the pathological assessment after NAC, patient responses to NAC were categorized into pCR and non-pCR. Three groups of radiomic textures were calculated in the segmented lesions, including (1) volumetric textures, (2) peripheral textures, and (3) wavelet-transformed textures. Six models for the prediction of pCR were Model I: group (1), Model II: group (1) + (2), Model III: group (3), Model IV: group (1) + (3), Model V: group (2) + (3), and Model VI: group (1) + (2) + (3). The performance of predicting models was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC). Results: The AUCs of the six models for the prediction of pCR were 0.816 ± 0.033 (Model I), 0.823 ± 0.020 (Model II), 0.888 ± 0.025 (Model III), 0.876 ± 0.015 (Model IV), 0.885 ± 0.030 (Model V), and 0.874 ± 0.019 (Model VI). The performance of four models with wavelet-transformed textures (Models III, IV, V, and VI) was significantly better than those without wavelet-transformed textures (Model I and II). In addition, the inclusion of volumetric textures or peripheral textures or both did not result in any improvements in performance. Conclusions: Wavelet-transformed textures outperformed volumetric and/or peripheral textures in the radiomic MRI prediction of pCR to NAC for patients with LABC, which can potentially serve as a surrogate biomarker for the prediction of the response of LABC to NAC. © 2020 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response is an important indicator of patient survival in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), but predicting chemosensitivity remains a challenge in clinical practice. We developed an 86-gene-based random forest (RF) classifier capable of predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response (pathological Complete Response (pCR) or Residual Disease (RD)) in TNBC patients. The performance of pCR classification of the proposed model was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Precision Recall (PR) curve. The AUROC and AUPRC of the proposed model on the test set were 0.891 and 0.829, respectively. At a predefined specificity (>90%), the proposed model shows a superior sensitivity compared to the best performing reported NAC response prediction model (69.2% vs. 36.9%). Moreover, the predicted pCR status by the model well explains the distance recurrence free survival (DRFS) of TNBC patients. In addition, the pCR probabilities of the proposed model using the expression profiles of the CCLE TNBC cell lines show a high Spearman rank correlation with cyclophosphamide sensitivity in the TNBC cell lines (SRCC = 0.697, p-value= 0.031). Associations between the 86 genes and DNA repair/cell cycle mechanisms were provided through function enrichment analysis. Our study suggests that the random forest-based prediction model provides a reliable prediction of the clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and may explain chemosensitivity in TNBC. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract={In patients with locally advanced breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), some patients achieve a complete pathologic response (pCR), some achieve a partial response, and some do not respond at all or even progress. Accurate prediction of treatment response has the potential to improve patient care by improving prognostication, enabling de-escalation of toxic treatment that has little benefit, facilitating upfront use of novel targeted therapies, and avoiding delays to surgery. Visual inspection of a patient's tumor on multiparametric MRI is insufficient to predict that patient's response to NAC. However, machine learning and deep learning approaches using a mix of qualitative and quantitative MRI features have recently been applied to predict treatment response early in the course of or even before the start of NAC. This is a novel field but the data published so far has shown promising results. We provide an overview of the machine learning and deep learning models developed to date, as well as discuss some of the challenges to clinical implementation. © 2019 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Objectives: To investigate the ability of radiomic signatures based on MRI to evaluate the response and efficiency of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for treating breast cancers. Methods: 152 patients were included in this study at our institution between March 2017 and September 2019. All patients with breast cancer underwent a preoperative breast MRI and the Miller-Payne grading system was applied to evaluate response to NAC. Quantitative parameters were compared between patients with sensitive and insensitive responses to NAC and between those with pathological complete responses (pCR) and non-pCR. Four radiomic signatures were built based on T2W imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging and their combination, and radiomics scores (Rad-score) were calculated. The combination of the clinical factors and Rad-scores created a nomogram model. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association between MRI features and independent clinical risk factors. Results: 20 features and 18 features were selected to build the radiomic signature for evaluating sensitivity and the possibility of pCR, respectively. The combined radiomic signature and nomogram model showed a similar discrimination in the training (AUC 0.91, 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.96, 0.86-0.98) and validation (AUC 0.93, 0.91, 95%CI, 0.86-1.00, 0.82-1.00) sets. The clinical factor model exhibited reduced performance (AUC 0.74, 0.64, 95%CI, 0.64-0.84, 0.46-0.82) in terms of NAC sensitivity and pCR. Conclusions: The combined radiomic signature and nomogram model exhibited potential predictive power for predicting effective NAC treatment which can aid in the prognosis and guidance of treatment regimens. © 2020 British Institute of Radiology.

  abstract={Background: To investigate the potential of semiquantitative time-intensity curve parameters compared to textural radiomic features on arterial phase images by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for early prediction of breast cancer neoadjuvant therapy response. Methods: A retrospective study of 45 patients subjected to DCE-MRI by public datasets containing examination performed prior to the start of treatment and after the treatment first cycle (‘QIN Breast DCE-MRI’ and ‘QIN-Breast’) was performed. In total, 11 semiquantitative parameters and 50 texture features were extracted. Non-parametric test, receiver operating characteristic analysis with area under the curve (ROC-AUC), Spearman correlation coefficient, and Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni correction were applied. Results: Fifteen patients with pathological complete response (pCR) and 30 patients with non-pCR were analysed. Significant differences in median values between pCR patients and non-pCR patients were found for entropy, long-run emphasis, and busyness among the textural features, for maximum signal difference, washout slope, washin slope, and standardised index of shape among the dynamic semiquantitative parameters. The standardised index of shape had the best results with a ROC-AUC of 0.93 to differentiate pCR versus non-pCR patients. Conclusions: The standardised index of shape could become a clinical tool to differentiate, in the early stages of treatment, responding to non-responding patients. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Purpose: The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning (ML) models with MRI in predicting pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, we compared the pathologic complete response (pCR) prediction performance of ML + radiomics with that of a deep learning (DL) algorithm. Methods: A search for relevant studies published until December 20, 2021 was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies −2 criteria. The I2 value assessed the heterogeneity of the included studies as well as the decision to adopt a random effects model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was pooled to quantify the predictive accuracy. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression analysis, and sensitivity analysis were performed to detect potential sources of study heterogeneity. A funnel plot was used to investigate publication bias. The PROSPERO ID of our study was CRD42022284071. Result: Seventeen eligible studies encompassing 3392 patients were evaluated in the analysis. ML + MRI showed high accuracy (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.84–0.91) in predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy. In subgroup analysis, the AUC of the DL subgroup (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.88–0.97) was higher than that of the ML + radiomics subgroup (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.82–0.90) (P = 0.030). In the ML + radiomics subgroup, the studies using MRI combined with other parameters (clinical or histopathologic information; AUC = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.85–0.96) reported better performance than studies using only MRI parameters (AUC = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.78–0.86) (P = 0.009). Conclusions: ML applied to MRI enabled moderate accuracy in predicting pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, the meta-analysis showed that DL had higher predictive accuracy than ML + radiomics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Background and Objective: Chemotherapy is useful to many breast cancer patients, however, it is not therapeutic for some patients. Pathologic complete response (pCR) is an indicator to good response in Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). In this study, we aimed to develop a way to predict pCR before NAC. Methods: We retrospectively collected 287 stage II-III breast cancer cases either to a training set (N = 197) or to a test set (N = 90). Fourteen candidate genes were selected from four public microarray data sets. A prediction model was built, by using these fourteen candidate genes and three reference genes expression which were tested by TaqMan probe-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction, after selecting a better algorithm. Results: The Naive Bayes algorithm had a relatively higher predictive value, compared with random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (knn) algorithms (P < 0.05). This 17-gene prediction model showed a high positive correlation with pCR (odds ratio, 8.914, 95% confidence interval, 4.430–17.934, P < 0.001). By using this model, the enrolled patients were classified into sensitive (SE) and insensitive (INS) groups. The pCR rates between the SE and INS groups were highly different (42.3% vs.7.6%, P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of this prediction model were 84.5% and 62.0%. Conclusions: Instead of whole transcriptome-based technologies, panel gene expression with tens of essential genes implemented in a machine learning model has predictive potential for chemosensitivity in breast cancers. © 2020},

  abstract={Purpose: The aim of the study was to develop and validate a deep learning radiomic nomogram (DLRN) for preoperatively assessing breast cancer pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) based on the pre- and post-treatment ultrasound. Methods: Patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) proved by biopsy who proceeded to undergo preoperative NAC were enrolled from hospital #1 (training cohort, 356 cases) and hospital #2 (independent external validation cohort, 236 cases). Deep learning and handcrafted radiomic features reflecting the phenotypes of the pre-treatment (radiomic signature [RS] 1) and post-treatment tumour (RS2) were extracted. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used for feature selection and RS construction. A DLRN was then developed based on the RSs and independent clinicopathological risk factors. The performance of the model was assessed with regard to calibration, discrimination and clinical usefulness. Results: The DLRN predicted the pCR status with accuracy, yielded an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.91–0.97) in the validation cohort, with good calibration. The DLRN outperformed the clinical model and single RS within both cohorts (P < 0.05, as per the DeLong test) and performed better than two experts' prediction of pCR (both P < 0.01 for comparison of total accuracy). Besides, prediction within the hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative, HER2+ and triple-negative subgroups also achieved good discrimination performance, with an AUC of 0.90, 0.95 and 0.93, respectively, in the external validation cohort. Decision curve analysis confirmed that the model was clinically useful. Conclusion: A deep learning–based radiomic nomogram had good predictive value for pCR in LABC, which could provide valuable information for individual treatment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Background: Most breast cancer (BC) patients fail to achieve pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether imaging features (perfusion/diffusion imaging biomarkers + radiomic features) extracted from pre-treatment multiparametric (mp)MRIs were able to predict, alone or in combination with clinical data, pCR to NAC. Methods: Patients with stage II-III BC receiving NAC and undergoing breast mpMRI were retrospectively evaluated. Imaging features were extracted from mpMRIs performed before NAC. Three different machine learning models based on imaging features, clinical data or imaging features + clinical data were trained to predict pCR. Confusion matrices and performance metrics were obtained to assess model performance. Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate differences between responders and non-responders. Results: Fifty-eight patients (median [range] age, 52 [45–58] years) were included, of whom 12 showed pCR. The combined model improved pCR prediction compared to clinical and imaging models, yielding 91.5% of accuracy with no false positive cases and only 17% false negative results. Changes in different parameters between responders and non-responders suggested a possible increase in vascularity and reduced tumour heterogeneity in patients with pCR, with the percentile 25th of time-to-peak (TTP), a classical perfusion parameter, being able to discriminate both groups in a 75% of the cases. Conclusions: A combination of mpMRI-derived imaging features and clinical variables was able to successfully predict pCR to NAC.

  abstract={Purpose: We aimed to develop a predictive model based on pretreatment MRI radiomic features (MRIRF) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels, an established prognostic marker, to improve the accuracy of predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Methods: This Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved retrospective study included a preliminary set of 80 women with biopsy-proven TNBC who underwent NAST, pretreatment dynamic contrast enhanced MRI, and biopsy-based pathologic assessment of TIL. A threshold of ≥ 20% was used to define high TIL. Patients were classified into pCR and non-pCR based on pathologic evaluation of post-NAST surgical specimens. pCR was defined as the absence of invasive carcinoma in the surgical specimen. Segmentation and MRIRF extraction were done using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved software QuantX. The top five features were combined into a single MRIRF signature value. Results: Of 145 extracted MRIRF, 38 were significantly correlated with pCR. Five nonredundant imaging features were identified: volume, uniformity, peak timepoint variance, homogeneity, and variance. The accuracy of the MRIRF model, P = .001, 72.7% positive predictive value (PPV), 72.0% negative predictive value (NPV), was similar to the TIL model (P = .038, 65.5% PPV, 72.6% NPV). When MRIRF and TIL models were combined, we observed improved prognostic accuracy (P < .001, 90.9% PPV, 81.4% NPV). The models area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.632 (TIL), 0.712 (MRIRF) and 0.752 (TIL + MRIRF). Conclusion: A predictive model combining pretreatment MRI radiomic features with TIL level on pretreatment core biopsy improved accuracy in predicting pCR to NAST in TNBC patients. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Purpose: This study used machine learning classification of texture features from MRI of breast tumor and peri-tumor at multiple treatment time points in conjunction with molecular subtypes to predict eventual pathological complete response (PCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Materials and method: This study employed a subset of patients (N = 166) with PCR data from the I-SPY-1 TRIAL (2002–2006). This cohort consisted of patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer that underwent anthracycline–cyclophosphamide and taxane treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, early, and mid-treatment. Texture features were extracted from post-contrast-enhanced MRI, pre- and post-contrast subtraction images, and with morphological dilation to include peri-tumoral tissue. Molecular subtypes and Ki67 were also included in the prediction model. Performance of classification models used the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis including area under the curve (AUC). Statistical analysis was done using unpaired two-tailed t-tests. Results: Molecular subtypes alone yielded moderate prediction performance of PCR (AUC = 0.82, p = 0.07). Pre-, early, and mid-treatment data alone yielded moderate performance (AUC = 0.88, 0.72, and 0.78, p = 0.03, 0.13, 0.44, respectively). The combined pre- and early treatment data markedly improved performance (AUC = 0.96, p = 0.0003). Addition of molecular subtypes improved performance slightly for individual time points but substantially for the combined pre- and early treatment (AUC = 0.98, p = 0.0003). The optimal morphological dilation was 3–5 pixels. Subtraction of post- and pre-contrast MRI further improved performance (AUC = 0.98, p = 0.00003). Finally, among the machine-learning algorithms evaluated, the RUSBoosted Tree machine-learning method yielded the highest performance. Conclusion: AI-classification of texture features from MRI of breast tumor at multiple treatment time points accurately predicts eventual PCR. Longitudinal changes in texture features and peri-tumoral features further improve PCR prediction performance. Accurate assessment of treatment efficacy early on could minimize unnecessary toxic chemotherapy and enable mid-treatment modification for patients to achieve better clinical outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: There are limited data on pretreatment imaging features that can predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). To extract volumetric pretreatment MRI radiomics features and assess corresponding associations with breast cancer molecular subtypes, pathological complete response (pCR), and residual cancer burden (RCB) in patients treated with NAC. Materials and Methods: In this IRB-approved study, clinical and pretreatment MRI data from patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer who received NAC between September 2009 and July 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Tumors were manually identified and semi-automatically segmented on first postcontrast images. Morphological and three-dimensional textural features were computed, including unfiltered and filtered image data, with spatial scaling factors (SSF) of 2, 4, and 6 mm. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were used for statistical analysis. Results: Two hundred and fifty nine patients with unilateral breast cancer, including 73 (28.2%) HER2+, 112 (43.2%) luminal, and 74 (28.6%) triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), were included. There was a significant difference in the median volume (p = 0.008), median longest axial tumor diameter (p = 0.009), and median longest volumetric diameter (p = 0.01) among tumor subtypes. There was also a significant difference in minimum signal intensity and entropy among the tumor subtypes with SSF = 4 mm (p = 0.009 and p = 0.02 respectively) and SSF = 6 mm (p = 0.007 and p < 0.001 respectively). Additionally, sphericity (p = 0.04) in HER2+ tumors and entropy with SSF = 2, 4, 6 mm (p = 0.004, 0.02, 0.047 respectively) in luminal tumors were significantly associated with pCR. Multiple features demonstrated significant association (p < 0.05) with pCR in TNBC and with RCB in luminal tumors and TNBC, with standard deviation of intensity with SSF = 6 mm achieving the highest AUC (AUC = 0.734) for pCR in TNBC. Conclusion: MRI radiomics features are associated with different molecular subtypes of breast cancer, pCR, and RCB. These features may be noninvasive imaging biomarkers to identify cancer subtype and predict response to NAC. © 2020 The Association of University Radiologists},

  abstract={Purpose: Neoadjuvant pharmacotherapy is essential for patients with breast cancer who wish to preserve the breast by shrinking the malignant tumor, allowing breast-conserving surgery. It may eliminate cancer cells completely, which is known as pathologic complete response (pCR). Patients with pCR have a lower risk of recurrence. The purpose of this study was to develop a method for predicting patients who achieve pCR by neoadjuvant pharmacotherapy using radiomic features in MR images. Methods: Fat-suppressed T2-weighted MR images of 64 cases were identified from the ISPY1 dataset. There were 26 cases of pCR and 38 cases of non-pCR. The image slice with the largest tumor diameter was selected from MR images, and the tumor region was manually segmented. A total of 371 radiomic features were calculated from the tumor region. We selected nine radiomic features using Lasso in this study. A support vector machine (SVM) with nine radiomic features was used for predicting patients with pCR. Results: The result of the ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve of SVM was 0.92 for distinguishing between pCR and non-pCR. Although the input data contain data that were misclassified by SVM, the survival curve classified into the pCR group was at a higher position than the non-pCR group. However, the log-rank test was p= 0.2. Conclusions: We developed a method to predict patients with pCR by neoadjuvant pharmacotherapy using noninvasive MR images. The survival curve of patients classified as having pCR by the proposed method was higher than those classified as non-pCR. Since the proposed method predicts patients who achieve pCR by neoadjuvant pharmacotherapy, it enhances the value of preoperative image information. © 2022, CARS.},

  abstract={There is a need to identify biomarkers predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We previously obtained evidence that a polyamine signature in the blood is associated with TNBC development and progression. In this study, we evaluated whether plasma polyamines and other metabolites may identify TNBC patients who are less likely to respond to NACT. Pre-treatment plasma levels of acetylated polyamines were elevated in TNBC patients that had moderate to extensive tumor burden (RCB-II/III) following NACT compared to those that achieved a complete pathological response (pCR/RCB-0) or had minimal residual disease (RCB-I). We further applied artificial intelligence to comprehensive metabolic profiles to identify additional metabolites associated with treatment response. Using a deep learning model (DLM), a metabolite panel consisting of two polyamines as well as nine additional metabolites was developed for improved prediction of RCB-II/III. The DLM has potential clinical value for identifying TNBC patients who are unlikely to respond to NACT and who may benefit from other treatment modalities.

  abstract={Background: Previous studies have suggested that texture analysis is a promising tool in the diagnosis, characterization, and assessment of treatment response in various cancer types. Therefore, application of texture analysis may be helpful for early prediction of pathologic response in breast cancer. Purpose: To investigate whether texture analysis of features from MRI is associated with pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 136 women (mean age, 47.9 years; range, 31-70 years) who underwent NAC and subsequent surgery for breast cancer between January 2012 and August 2017. Patients were monitored with 3.0-T MRI before (pretreatment) and after (midtreatment) three or four cycles of NAC. Texture analysis was performed at pre- and midtreatment T2-weighted MRI, contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping by using commercial software. A random forest method was applied to build a predictive model for classifying those with pCR with use of texture parameters. Diagnostic performance for predicting pCR was assessed and compared with that of six other machine learning classifiers (adaptive boosting, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, linear support vector machine, naive Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis) by using the Wald test and DeLong method. Results: Forty of the 136 patients (29%) achieved pCR after NAC. In the prediction of pCR, the random forest classifier showed the lowest diagnostic performance with pretreatment ADC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.44, 0.61) and the highest diagnostic performance with midtreatment contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (AUC, 0.82; 95% confidence interval: 0.74, 0.88) among pre- and midtreatment T2-weighted MRI, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, and ADC mapping. Conclusion: Texture parameters using a random forest method of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI at midtreatment of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were valuable and associated with pathologic complete response in breast cancer. © RSNA, 2019},

  abstract={Background: The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning (ML) based model to accurately predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using pretreatment clinical and pathological characteristics of electronic medical record (EMR) data in breast cancer (BC). Methods: The EMR data from patients diagnosed with early and locally advanced BC and who received NAC followed by curative surgery were reviewed. A total of 16 clinical and pathological characteristics was selected to develop ML model. We practiced six ML models using default settings for multivariate analysis with extracted variables. Results: In total, 2065 patients were included in this analysis. Overall, 30.6% (n = 632) of patients achieved pCR. Among six ML models, the LightGBM had the highest area under the curve (AUC) for pCR prediction. After hyper-parameter tuning with Bayesian optimization, AUC was 0.810. Performance of pCR prediction models in different histology-based subtypes was compared. The AUC was highest in HR+HER2- subgroup and lowest in HR−/HER2- subgroup (HR+/HER2- 0.841, HR+/HER2+ 0.716, HR−/HER2 0.753, HR−/HER2- 0.653). Conclusions: A ML based pCR prediction model using pre-treatment clinical and pathological characteristics provided useful information to predict pCR during NAC. This prediction model would help to determine treatment strategy in patients with BC planned NAC. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background: The aim of the study was to develop a deep learning (DL) algorithm to evaluate the pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Methods: A total of 302 breast cancer patients in this retrospective study were randomly divided into a training set (n = 244) and a validation set (n = 58). Tumor regions were manually delineated on each slice by two expert radiologists on enhanced T1-weighted images. Pathological results were used as ground truth. Deep learning network contained five repetitions of convolution and max-pooling layers and ended with three dense layers. The pre-NAC model and post-NAC model inputted six phases of pre-NAC and post-NAC images, respectively. The combined model used 12 channels from six phases of pre-NAC and six phases of post-NAC images. All models above included three indexes of molecular type as one additional input channel. Results: The training set contained 137 non-pCR and 107 pCR participants. The validation set contained 33 non-pCR and 25 pCR participants. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of three models was 0.553 for pre-NAC, 0.968 for post-NAC and 0.970 for the combined data, respectively. A significant difference was found in AUC between using pre-NAC data alone and combined data (P < 0.001). The positive predictive value of the combined model was greater than that of the post-NAC model (100% vs. 82.8%, P = 0.033). Conclusion: This study established a deep learning model to predict PCR status after neoadjuvant therapy by combining pre-NAC and post-NAC MRI data. The model performed better than using pre-NAC data only, and also performed better than using post-NAC data only. Key points: Significant findings of the study. It achieved an AUC of 0.968 for pCR prediction. It showed a significantly greater AUC than using pre-NAC data only. What this study adds. This study established a deep learning model to predict PCR status after neoadjuvant therapy by combining pre-NAC and post-NAC MRI data. © 2020 The Authors.

  abstract={Objectives: In this proof of concept study, a deep learning–based method for automatic analysis of digital mammograms (DM) as a tool to aid in assessment of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) treatment response in breast cancer (BC) was examined. Methods: Baseline DM from 453 patients receiving NACT between 2005 and 2019 were included in the study cohort. A deep learning system, using the aforementioned baseline DM, was developed to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in the surgical specimen after completion of NACT. Two image patches, one extracted around the detected tumour and the other from the corresponding position in the reference image, were fed into a classification network. For training and validation, 1485 images obtained from 400 patients were used, and the model was ultimately applied to a test set consisting of 53 patients. Results: A total of 95 patients (21%) achieved pCR. The median patient age was 52.5 years (interquartile range 43.7–62.1), and 255 (56%) were premenopausal. The artificial intelligence (AI) model predicted the pCR as represented by the area under the curve of 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.53–0.90; p = 0.035). The sensitivity was 46% at a fixed specificity of 90%. Conclusions: Our study describes an AI platform using baseline DM to predict BC patients’ responses to NACT. The initial AI performance indicated the potential to aid in clinical decision-making. In order to continue exploring the clinical utility of AI in predicting responses to NACT for BC, further research, including refining the methodology and a larger sample size, is warranted. Key Points: • We aimed to answer the following question: Prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, can artificial intelligence (AI) applied to digital mammograms (DM) predict breast tumour response? • DMs contain information that AI can make use of for predicting pathological complete (pCR) response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. • By developing an AI system designed to focus on relevant parts of the DM, fully automatic pCR prediction can be done well enough to potentially aid in clinical decision-making. © 2021, The Author(s).},

In several studies, TIL density has been examined on hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections using DIA. The aim of the present study was to quantify TIL density on HE sections of core needle biopsies using DIA and investigate its association with clinicopathological parameters and pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. The study cohort comprised of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, all treated with neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy. DIA software applying machine learning-based classification of epithelial and stromal elements was used to count TILs. TIL density was determined as the number of TILs per square millimeter of stromal tissue. Median TIL density was 1287/mm2 (range, 123–8101/mm2). A high TIL density was associated with higher histological grade (P = 0.02), estrogen receptor negativity (P = 0.036), and pathological complete response (pCR) (P < 0.0001). In analyses using receiver operating characteristic curves, a threshold TIL density of 2420/mm2 best discriminated pCR from non-pCR. In multivariate analysis, high TIL density (> 2420/mm2) was significantly associated with pCR (P < 0.0001). Our results indicate that DIA can assess TIL density quantitatively, machine learning-based classification algorithm allowing determination of TIL density as the number of TILs per unit area, and TIL density established by this method appears to be an independent predictor of pCR in HER2-positive breast cancer. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={The assessment of neoadjuvant treatment's response is critical for selecting the most suitable therapeutic options for patients with breast cancer to reduce the need for invasive local therapies. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is so far one of the most accurate approaches for assessing pathological complete response, although this is limited by the qualitative and subjective nature of radiologists' assessment, often making it insufficient for deciding whether to forgo additional locoregional therapy measures. To increase the accuracy and prediction of radiomic MRI with the aid of machine learning models and deep learning methods, as part of artificial intelligence, have been used to analyse the different subtypes of breast cancer and the specific changes observed before and after therapy. This review discusses recent advancements in radiomic MRI models for presurgical response assessment for patients with early breast cancer receiving preoperative treatments, with a focus on their implications for clinical practice.},

  abstract={Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is a major treatment option for locally advanced rectal cancer. With recent advancement of machine/deep learning algorithms, predicting the treatment response of NAT has become possible using radiological and/or pathological images. However, programs reported thus far are limited to binary classifications, and they can only distinguish the pathological complete response (pCR). In the clinical setting, the pathological NAT responses are classified as four classes: (TRG0-3), with 0 as pCR, 1 as moderate response, 2 as minimal response and 3 as poor response. Therefore, the actual clinical need for risk stratification remains unmet. By using ResNet (Residual Neural Network), we developed a multi-class classifier based on Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) images to divide the response to three groups (TRG0, TRG1/2, and TRG3). Overall, the model achieved the AUC 0.97 at 40× magnification and AUC 0.89 at 10× magnification. For TRG0, the model under 40× magnification achieved a precision of 0.67, a sensitivity of 0.67, and a specificity of 0.95. For TRG1/2, a precision of 0.92, a sensitivity of 0.86, and a specificity of 0.89 were achieved. For TRG3, the model obtained a precision of 0.71, a sensitivity of 0.83, and a specificity of 0.88. To find the relationship between the treatment response and pathological images, we constructed a visual heat map of tiles using Class Activation Mapping (CAM). Notably, we found that tumor nuclei and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes appeared to be potential features of the algorithm. Taken together, this multi-class classifier represents the first of its kind to predict different NAT responses in rectal cancer.},

A literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science identified 51 relevant studies in the region, with the majority conducted in China, followed by South Korea and Japan. Most studies focused on predicting pathologic complete response (pCR), with a median sample size of 152 and largely retrospective single-center designs. Model performance was commonly assessed using validation sets, with pooled sensitivity and specificity for pCR prediction showing promising results. Models incorporating multitemporal MRI features were associated with improved accuracy. While MRI-based AI models show potential for guiding surgical planning, improved methodological quality and algorithmic explainability are needed to facilitate clinical translation.},

  abstract={Background: Pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) is an established prognostic marker in breast cancer (BC). Multimodal deep learning (DL), integrating diverse data sources (radiology, pathology, omics, clinical), holds promise for improving pCR prediction accuracy. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on multimodal DL for pCR prediction and compares its performance against unimodal DL. Methods: Following PRISMA, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (January 2015–April 2025) for studies applying DL to predict pCR in BC patients receiving NAST, using data from radiology, digital pathology (DP), multi-omics, and/or clinical records, and reporting AUC. Data on study design, DL architectures, and performance (AUC) were extracted. A narrative synthesis was conducted due to heterogeneity. Results: Fifty-one studies, mostly retrospective (90.2%, median cohort 281), were included. Magnetic resonance imaging and DP were common primary modalities. Multimodal approaches were used in 52.9% of studies, often combining imaging with clinical data. Convolutional neural networks were the dominant architecture (88.2%). Longitudinal imaging improved prediction over baseline-only (median AUC 0.91 vs. 0.82). Overall, the median AUC across studies was 0.88, with 35.3% achieving AUC ≥ 0.90. Multimodal models showed a modest but consistent improvement over unimodal approaches (median AUC 0.88 vs. 0.83). Omics and clinical text were rarely primary DL inputs. Conclusion: DL models demonstrate promising accuracy for pCR prediction, especially when integrating multiple modalities and longitudinal imaging. However, significant methodological heterogeneity, reliance on retrospective data, and limited external validation hinder clinical translation. Future research should prioritize prospective validation, integration underutilized data (multi-omics, clinical), and explainable AI to advance DL predictors to the clinical setting.},

  abstract={MOTIVATION Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Developing predictive models for TNBC treatment responses is crucial but challenging due to data scarcity and the reliance on cell line data, which limits clinical translational value. Leveraging omics data from clinical trials, particularly through auxiliary learning, offers a potential solution to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce data requirements. RESULTS In this study, we propose a new approach utilizing deep auxiliary task reweighting learning methods to automatically reweight auxiliary tasks, thereby optimizing the performance of the primary task of predicting TNBC treatment responses. We benchmark various auxiliary learning methods, including ARML, AdaLoss, GradNorm, and OL AUX, against traditional supervised machine learning algorithms and single-task learning baselines. Our results characterize the performance of auxiliary learning across various contexts, including utilizing parallel treatment arms within a multi-arm clinical trial, leveraging treatment arms from different clinical trials, and integrating multiple arms with the same treatment regimens across separate clinical trials. The last scenario also provides an opportunity for validating prediction models on an independent dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of the auxiliary learning models in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) in TNBC patients treated with standardized combinational chemotherapy with Taxane, Anthracycline, and Cyclophosphamide (TAC).

  abstract={Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are ectopic lymphoid aggregates found in numerous cancers, often linked to enhanced immunotherapy responses and better clinical outcomes. However, the factors driving TLS maturation are not fully understood. Using near single-cell spatial transcriptomic mapping, we comprehensively profile TLSs under various maturation stages and their microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on their developmental trajectories, we classify immature TLSs into two groups: conforming and deviating TLSs. Our findings indicate that conforming TLSs, similar to mature TLSs, possess a niche function for immunotherapy responses, while deviating TLSs do not. We discover that the tryptophan-enriched metabolic microenvironment shaped by malignant cells contributes to the deviation of TLS maturation. Inhibiting tryptophan metabolism promotes intratumoral TLS maturation and enhances tumor control, synergizing with anti-PD-1 treatments. Therefore, promoting TLS maturation represents a potential strategy to improve antitumor responses and immunotherapy outcomes.},

  abstract={Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the main components in the tumor microenvironment. Tumors activate fibroblasts from quiescent state into activated state by secreting cytokines, and activated CAFs may in turn promote tumor progression and metastasis. Therefore, studies targeting CAFs could enrich the therapeutic options for tumor treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that the content of lipid droplets and the expression of autophagosomes were higher in CAFs than in peri-tumor fibroblasts (PTFs), which was inhibited by 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid(TOFA). The expression of CD36 in CAFs was higher than that in PTFs at both mRNA and protein levels. Inhibition of CD36 activity using either the CD36 inhibitor SSO or siRNA had a significant negative impact on the proliferation and migration abilities of CAFs, which was associated with reduced levels of relevant activated genes (α-SMA, FAP, Vimentin) and cytokines (IL-6, TGF-β and VEGF-α). SSO also inhibited HCC growth and tumorigenesis in nude mice orthotopically implanted with CAFs and HCC cells. Our data further show that CD36+CAFs affected the expression of PD-1 in CTLs leading to CTL exhaustion, and that patients with high CD36 expression in CAFs were correlated with shorter overall survival (OS). Together, our data demonstrate that CAFs were active in lipid metabolism with increased lipid content and lipophagy activity. CD36 may play a key role in the regulation of the biological behaviors of CAFs, which may influence the proliferation and migration of tumor cells by reprograming the lipid metabolism in tumor cells. Thus, CD36 could be an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.},

  abstract={B7-H3 is a common oncogene found in various cancer types. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal B7-H3 expression and colorectal cancer (CRC) progression need to be extensively explored. B7-H3 was upregulated in human CRC tissues and its abnormal expression was correlated with a poor prognosis in CRC patients. Notably, gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that B7-H3 knockdown substantially inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, whereas exogenous B7-H3 expression yielded contrasting results. In addition, silencing of B7-H3 inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, our study demonstrated that the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) binding protein YTHDF1 augmented B7-H3 expression in an m6A-dependent manner. Furthermore, rescue experiments demonstrated that reintroduction of B7-H3 considerably abolished the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and invasion induced by silencing YTHDF1. Our results suggest that the YTHDF1-m6A-B7-H3 axis is crucial for CRC development and progression and may represent a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatment.},

Second, analysis of patients with glioblastoma versus asymptomatic healthy controls in an independent validation series (n = 347) provided a detection accuracy of 95% and AUC of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95–0.99; p < 0.001). Finally, we developed the digitalSWARM algorithm to improve monitoring of glioblastoma progression and demonstrate that the TEP tumor scores of individual glioblastoma patients represent tumor behavior and could be used to distinguish false positive progression from true progression (validation series, n = 20; accuracy, 85%; AUC, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.70–1.00; p < 0.012]).

Here, we identify the CYP19A1 gene encoding for the testosterone-to-estradiol metabolizing enzyme CYP19A1 (also known as aromatase) as a host factor that contributes to worsened disease outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected males. We analyzed exome sequencing data obtained from a human COVID-19 cohort (n = 2,866) using a machine-learning approach and identify a CYP19A1-activity-increasing mutation to be associated with the development of severe disease in men but not women. We further analyzed human autopsy-derived lungs (n = 86) and detect increased pulmonary CYP19A1 expression at the time point of death in men compared with women. In the golden hamster model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes increased CYP19A1 expression in the lung that is associated with dysregulated plasma sex hormone levels and reduced long-term pulmonary function in males but not females. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with a clinically approved CYP19A1 inhibitor (letrozole) improves impaired lung function and supports recovery of imbalanced sex hormones specifically in males. Our study identifies CYP19A1 as a contributor to sex-specific SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome in males. Furthermore, inhibition of CYP19A1 by the clinically approved drug letrozole may furnish a new therapeutic strategy for individualized patient management and treatment.},

Recent studies about EV-miRNAs have gained novel insights into cancer biology and have demonstrated a great potential to develop novel liquid biopsy assays for various applications. Notably, compared to conventional liquid biomarkers, EV-miRNAs are more advantageous in representing host-cell molecular architecture and exhibiting higher stability and specificity. Despite various available techniques for EV-miRNA separation, concentration, profiling, and data analysis, a standardized approach for EV-miRNA biomarker development is yet lacking. In this review, we performed a substantial literature review and distilled an integrated workflow encompassing important steps for EV-miRNA biomarker development, including sample collection and EV isolation, EV-miRNA extraction and quantification, high-throughput data preprocessing, biomarker prioritization and model construction, functional analysis, as well as validation. With the rapid growth of “big data”, we highlight the importance of efficient mining of high-throughput data for the discovery of EV-miRNA biomarkers and integrating multiple independent datasets for in silico and experimental validations to increase the robustness and reproducibility. Furthermore, as an efficient strategy in systems biology, network inference provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms and can be used to select functionally important EV-miRNAs to refine the biomarker candidates. Despite the encouraging development in the field, a number of challenges still hinder the clinical translation. We finally summarize several common challenges in various biomarker studies and discuss potential opportunities emerging in the related fields.},

However, the intrinsic mechanisms and underlying correlation of pyroptosis-related lncRNAs (PRLs) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unclear. The objective of the current research was to identify pyroptosis-related lncRNAs and a prognostic model to predict the prognosis of patients. We extracted pyroptosis-related lncRNAs to construct a risk model and validated them at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. Crosstalk between lncRNA SNHG10 and GSDMD was found to regulate pyroptosis levels. A new algorithm was used to establish a 0 or 1 PRL pair matrix and prognostic model. Six pyroptosis-related lncRNA pairs were identified and utilized to construct a risk model. The low-risk groups exhibited better prognoses than the high-risk groups. The area under the curve (AUC) indicated extremely high accuracy, reaching 0.810 at 1 year, 0.850 at 2 years, and 0.850 at 3 years in the training set. Patients with different risk scores exhibited distinct metabolic, inflammatory, and immune microenvironments as well as tumor mutation landscapes. Additionally, 9 commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs exhibited different sensitivities between the high- and low-risk groups. To conclude, we propose that pyroptosis exhibits a close correlation with PDAC. Our risk model based on PRL pairs may be beneficial for the accurate estimation of prognostic outcomes, the immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity, bringing therapeutic hope for patients with PDAC.},

  abstract={Resistance to trastuzumab and the poor efficacy of subsequent chemotherapy have become major challenges for HER2-positive gastric cancer (GC). As resistance evolves, tumor cells may acquire a new drug susceptibility profile, profoundly impacting the subsequent treatment selection and patient survival. However, the interplay between trastuzumab and other types of drugs in HER2-positive GC remains elusive. In our study, we utilized resistant cell lines and tissue specimens to map the drug susceptibility profile of trastuzumab-resistant GC, discovering that resistance to trastuzumab induces collateral resistance to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, patients with collateral resistance distinguished by a 13-gene scoring model in HER2-positive GC cohorts are predicted to have a poor prognosis and may be sensitive to cholesterol-lowering drugs. Mechanistically, endosomal cholesterol transport is further confirmed to enrich cholesterol in the plasma membrane, contributing to collateral resistance through the Hedgehog-ABCB1 axis. As a driver for cholesterol, Cdc42 is activated by the formation of the NPC1-TβRI-Cdc42 complex to facilitate endosomal cholesterol transport. We demonstrated that inhibiting Cdc42 activation with ZCL278 reduces cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane and reverses collateral resistance between trastuzumab and chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings verify the phenomena and mechanism of collateral resistance between trastuzumab and chemotherapy, and propose a potential therapeutic target and strategy in the second-line treatment for trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive GC.},

Ly6Ehi neutrophils are induced by tumor-intrinsic activation of the STING (stimulator of interferon genes) signaling pathway and possess the ability to directly sensitize otherwise non-responsive tumors to anti-PD1 therapy, in part through IL12b-dependent activation of cytotoxic T cells. By translating our pre-clinical findings to a cohort of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma (n = 109), and to public data (n = 1440), we demonstrate the ability of Ly6Ehi neutrophils to predict immunotherapy response in humans with high accuracy (average AUC ≈ 0.9).

Here, we address personalization of treatment timing using a novel mathematical model of irinotecan cellular pharmacokinetics and –dynamics linked to a representation of the core clock and predict treatment toxicity in a colorectal cancer (CRC) cellular model. The mathematical model is fitted to three different scenarios: mouse liver, where the drug metabolism mainly occurs, and two human colorectal cancer cell lines representing an in vitro experimental system for human colorectal cancer progression. Our model successfully recapitulates quantitative circadian datasets of mRNA and protein expression together with timing-dependent irinotecan cytotoxicity data. The model also discriminates time-dependent toxicity between the different cells, suggesting that treatment can be optimized according to their cellular clock. Our results show that the time-dependent degradation of the protein mediating irinotecan activation, as well as an oscillation in the death rate may play an important role in the circadian variations of drug toxicity. In the future, this model can be used to support personalized treatment scheduling by predicting optimal drug timing based on the patient's gene expression profile.},

  abstract={Cancer has risen up to be a major cause of mortality worldwide over the past decades. Despite advancements in cancer screening and diagnostics, a significant number of cancers are still diagnosed at a late stage with poor prognosis. Hence, the discovery of reliable and accurate methods to diagnose cancer early would be of great help in reducing cancer mortality. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are phospholipid vesicles found in many biofluids and are released by almost all types of cells. In recent years, using EVs as cancer biomarkers has garnered attention as a novel technique of cancer diagnosis. Compared with traditional tissue biopsy, there are many advantages that this novel diagnostic tool presents - it is less invasive, detects early-stage asymptomatic cancers, and allows for monitoring of tumour progression. As such, EV biomarkers have great potential in improving the diagnostic accuracy of cancers and guiding subsequent therapeutic decisions. Efficient isolation and accurate characterization of EVs are essential for reliable outcomes of clinical application. However, these are complicated by the size and biomolecular diversity of EVs. In this review, we present an analysis and evaluation of the current techniques of EV isolation and characterization, as well as discuss the potential EV biomarkers for specific types of cancer. Taken together, EV biomarkers have a lot of potential as a novel method in cancer diagnostics and diagnosis. However, more work is still needed to streamline the purification, characterization and biomarker identification process to ensure optimal outcomes for patients.},

The focus was on the role of MAGI2-AS3, delivered by BMSC-EVs, in regulating USP6NL DNA methylation-mediated MYC protein translation modification to promote CDK2 downregulation. Utilizing bioinformatics analysis, we identified significant enrichment of MAGI2-AS3 related to copper-induced cell death in CRC. In vitro experiments demonstrated the downregulation of MAGI2-AS3 in CRC cells, and BMSC-EVs were found to deliver MAGI2-AS3 to inhibit CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Further exploration revealed that MAGI2-AS3 suppressed MYC protein translation modification by regulating USP6NL DNA methylation, leading to CDK2 downregulation and prevention of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of MYC reversed the functional effects of BMSC-EVs-MAGI2-AS3. In vivo experiments validated the inhibitory impact of BMSC-EVs-MAGI2-AS3 on CRC tumorigenicity by promoting CDK2 downregulation through USP6NL DNA methylation-mediated MYC protein translation modification. Overall, BMSC-EVs-MAGI2-AS3 may serve as a potential intervention to prevent CRC occurrence by modulating key molecular pathways.},

Design: Multicentric, prospective study. Setting: Reproductive medicine research department in a public hospital affiliated with private fertility clinics and a reproductive genetics laboratory. Patients: Caucasian women (n = 281; 39.4 ± 4.8 years old with a body mass index of 22.9 ± 3.5 kg/m2) undergoing hormone replacement therapy between July 2018 and July 2021. Endometrial samples from 217 patients met RNA quality criteria for signature discovery and analysis. Intervention(s): Endometrial biopsies collected in the mid-secretory phase. Main Outcome Measure(s): Endometrial luteal phase timing-corrected expression of 404 genes and reproductive outcomes of the first single embryo transfer (SET) after biopsy collection to identify prognostic biomarkers of endometrial failure. Results: Removal of endometrial timing variation from gene expression data allowed patients to be stratified into poor (n = 137) or good (n = 49) endometrial prognosis groups on the basis of their clinical and transcriptomic profiles. Significant differences were found between endometrial prognosis groups in terms of reproductive rates: pregnancy (44.6% vs. 79.6%), live birth (25.6% vs. 77.6%), clinical miscarriage (22.2% vs. 2.6%), and biochemical miscarriage (20.4% vs. 0%). The relative risk of endometrial failure for patients predicted as a poor endometrial prognosis was 3.3 times higher than those with a good prognosis. The differences in gene expression between both profiles were proposed as a biomarker, coined the endometrial failure risk (EFR) signature. Poor prognosis profiles were characterized by 59 upregulated and 63 downregulated genes mainly involved in regulation (17.0%), metabolism (8.4%), immune response, and inflammation (7.8%). This EFR signature had a median accuracy of 0.92 (min = 0.88, max = 0.94), median sensitivity of 0.96 (min = 0.91, max = 0.98), and median specificity of 0.84 (min = 0.77, max = 0.88), positioning itself as a promising biomarker for endometrial evaluation. Conclusion(s): The EFR signature revealed a novel endometrial disruption, independent of endometrial luteal phase timing, present in 73.7% of patients. This EFR signature stratified patients into 2 significantly distinct and clinically relevant prognosis profiles providing opportunities for personalized therapy. Nevertheless, further validations are needed before implementing this gene signature as an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool to reduce the risk of patients experiencing endometrial failure.},

  abstract={Background: High mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) is considered as a biomarker of poor prognosis in various cancers.This study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of HMGB2 in gliomas. Methods: With the glioma related on-line and our local hospital databases, the expression differences of HMGB2,Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and COX regression analysis were performed.The correlation analysis between the clinicopathological features and imaging parameters with the HMGB2 expression had been done. Then GSEA and PPI networks were carried out to find out the most significant pathway. The pathway inhibitor was applied to verify HMGB2’s participation. CCK8,EDU assays,γ-H2AX immunofluorescence staining and colony formation assay were conducted to observe effects on glioma cells. Results: Available datasets showed that HMGB2 was highly expressed in glioma and patients with high expression of HMGB2 had poorer prognosis and molecular characteristics. Protein level evidence of western blot and immunohistochemistry from our center supported the conclusions above. Analysis on imaging features suggested that HMGB2 expression level had an inverse association with ADCmean but positively with the thickness of enhancing margin. Results from GSEA and PPI network analysis exhibited that HMGB2 was involved in base excision repair (BER) signaling pathway. Experimental evidence demonstrated that the overexpression of HMGB2 promoted the proliferation of glioma cells and enhanced the radio-resistance. Conclusions: HMGB2 could promote glioma development and enhance the radioresistance of glioma cells, potentially related to the BER pathway, suggesting it may serve as an underlying biomarker for patients with glioma.},

  abstract={Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most usual malignant tumors, and its incidence continues to rise. Our purpose was to explore the function and potential regulatory mechanisms of SALL1, a differentially methylated gene in CRC, in vivo and in vitro. Methods: Firstly, methylation differential gene SALL1 in CRC was screened and validated. SALL1 overexpression plasmids or SALL1 siRNAs were transfected in HT-29 and SW480 cells. Moreover, 10 μM T-5224 was added in SALL1-overexpressed CRC cells. CCK-8, flow cytometry and transwell assays were utilized to assess cell proliferation, cycle, migration, and invasion, respectively. Then CRC organoids were cultured. Next, HT-29 and SW480 cells transfected with SALL1 overexpression lentivirus were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing. Finally, in vivo tumorigenesis was used to analyze the effect of SALL1 overexpression on subcutaneous tumorigenesis in nude mice. Results: The methylation level of CpG island in SALL1 promoter was increased in CRC tissues and could distinguish tumor tissues. Overexpression of SALL1 accelerated proliferation, migration and invasion of HT-29 and SW480 cells, and silencing of SALL1 attenuated proliferation, migration and invasion of HT-29 and SW480 cells. Through analysis and validation, we found that overexpression of SALL1 also could upregulate p-p65 and p-JUN expressions. Besides, c-Fos/activator protein (AP)− 1 inhibitor (T-5224) could reverse the induction of CRC progression by SALL1 overexpression. In vivo, we also proved that overexpression of SALL1 significantly increased tumor volume, tumor weight, and p-JUN expression. Conclusions: SALL1 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells and activate phosphorylation of p65 and JUN.},

  abstract={Treatment strategies for paediatric neuroblastoma as well as many other cancers are limited by the unfavourable tumour microenvironment (TME). In this study, the TMEs of neuroblastoma were grouped by their genetic signatures into four distinct subtypes: immune enriched, immune desert, non-proliferative and fibrotic. An Immune Score and a Proliferation Score were constructed based on the molecular features of the subtypes to quantify the immune microenvironment or malignancy degree of cancer cells in neuroblastoma, respectively. The Immune Score correlated with a patient's response to immunotherapy; the Proliferation Score was an independent prognostic biomarker for neuroblastoma and proved to be more accurate than the existing clinical predictors. This double scoring system was further validated and the conserved molecular pattern associated with immune landscape and malignancy degree was confirmed. Axitinib and BI-2536 were confirmed as candidate drugs for neuroblastoma by the double scoring system. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that axitinib-induced pyroptosis of neuroblastoma cells activated anti-tumour immunity and inhibited tumour growth; BI-2536 induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase in neuroblastoma cells. The comprehensive double scoring system of neuroblastoma may predict prognosis and screen for therapeutic strategies which could provide personalized treatments.},

  abstract={Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling is vitally important in tumour development and progression. This study is the first to comprehensively analyse the role of MAPK-family genes in the progression, prognosis, immune-cell infiltration, methylation, and potential therapeutic value drug candidates in ccRCC. We identified a novel prognostic panel of six MAPK-signature genes (MAP3K12, MAP3K1, MAP3K5, MAPK1, MAPK8, MAPK9), and introduced a robust MAPK-signature risk model for predicting ccRCC prognosis. Model construction, evaluation, and external validation using datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database demonstrated its stability, as well as high sensitivity and specificity. Enrichment analysis suggested the participation of immune-mediated mechanism in MAPK dysregulation in ccRCC. Immune-infiltration analysis confirmed the relationship and revealed that the MAPK-signature risk model might stratify immunotherapy response in ccRCC, which was verified in drug sensitivity analysis and validated in external ccRCC immunotherapy dataset (GSE67501). Potential therapeutic drug predictions for key MAPKs using DSigDB, Network Analyst, CTD, and DGIdb were subsequently verified by molecular docking with AutoDock Vina and PyMol. Mendelian randomization further demonstrated the possibilities of the MAPK-signature genes as targets for therapeutic drugs in ccRCC. Methylation analysis using UALCAN and MethSurv revealed the participation of epigenetic modifications in dysregulation and survival difference of MAPK pathway in ccRCC. Among the key MAPKs, MAP3K12 exhibited the highest significance, indicating its independent prognostic value as single gene in ccRCC. Knockout and overexpression validation experiments in vitro and in vivo found that MAP3K12 acted as a promoter of tumour progression in RCC, suggesting a pivotal role for MAP3K12 in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of RCC cells. Our findings proposed the potential of MAPK-signature genes as biomarkers for prognosis and therapy response, as well as targets for therapeutic drugs in ccRCC.},

  abstract={Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is the standard for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). However, distant metastasis remains the primary cause of treatment failure. Early identification of high-risk individuals for personalized treatment may offer a solution. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) could assist in this process. Methods: From September 2017 to June 2019, the study prospectively recruited 113 patients with LARC (cT3-4N0M0 or cTanyN + M0) who underwent nCRT followed by radical surgery across 8 tertiary centers. ctDNA was analysed using large-panel targeted sequencing at baseline, during nCRT, pre-surgery, post-surgery, post-adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT), and during annual follow-ups for 3 years. Findings: We analysed 103 tissue and 669 plasma samples from 103 patients. With a median 53-month follow-up, significantly worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed if median variant allele frequency (mVAF) of baseline ctDNA per patient was ≥0.5% (PFS, HR 4.39, p < 0.001; OS, HR 5.61, p = 0.004) or ctDNA was still detectable two weeks into nCRT (PFS, HR 7.63, p < 0.001; OS, HR 5.08, p < 0.001). Furthermore, when compared to the low-risk (C1) group (characterized by “ctDNA undetected during nCRT with baseline mVAF <0.5%” or “ctDNA undetected during nCRT with TMB (tumour mutational burden) ≥20/Mb”), the high-risk (C2) group (characterized by “ctDNA detected during nCRT” or “baseline mVAF ≥0.5% with TMB <20/Mb”) showed significantly worse long-term outcomes (3 y-PFS, 55.9% vs. 94.2%; 3 y-OS, 79.4% vs. 100%). The ctDNA clearance during nCRT, baseline mVAF, and TMB may be effective prognostic indicators. Interpretation: Our findings reaffirm the clinical monitoring value of ctDNA and demonstrate the strong prognostic value of baseline ctDNA and its early clearance status in patients with LARC undergoing nCRT. This highlights the potential of dynamic ctDNA monitoring as actionable stratified indicators to guide personalized neoadjuvant treatment strategies.

  abstract={Background: Activation of various cancer stem cell pathways are thought to be responsible for treatment failure and loco-regional recurrence in Head and Neck cancer. Hedgehog signaling, a major cancer stem signaling pathway plays a major role in relapse of disease. GLI1, a transcription activator, plays an important role in canonical/non-canonical activation of Hedgehog signaling. Methods: Data for H&N cancer patients were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas- H&N Cancer (TCGA-HNSC). GLI1 co-expressed genes in TCGA-HNSC were then identified using cBioPortal and subjected to KEGG pathway analysis by DAVID tool. Network Analyzer and GeneMania plugins from CytoScape were used to identify hub genes and predict a probable pathway from the identified hub genes respectively. To confirm the hypothesis, real-time gene expression was carried out in 75 patients of head and neck cancer. Results: Significantly higher GLI1 expression was observed in tumor tissues of H&N cancer and it also showed worst overall survival. Using cBioPortal tool, 2345 genes were identified that were significantly co-expressed with GLI1. From which, 15 hub genes were identified through the Network Analyzer plugin in CytoScape. A probable pathway prediction based on hub genes showed the interconnected molecular mechanism and its role in non-canonical activation of Hedgehog pathway by altering the GLI1 activity. The expressions of SHH, GLI1 and AKT1 were significant with each other and were found to be significantly associated with Age, Lymph-Node status and Keratin. Conclusion: The study emphasizes the critical role of the Hh pathway's activation modes in H&N cancer, particularly highlighting the non-canonical activation through GLI1 and AKT1. The identification of SHH, GLI1 and AKT1 as potential diagnostic biomarkers and their association with clinic-pathological parameters underscores their relevance in prognostication and treatment planning. Hh pathway activation through GLI1 and its cross-talk with various pathways opens up the possibility of newer treatment strategies and developing a panel of therapeutic targets in H&N cancer patients.},

  abstract={Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the primary factors that produces treatment failure in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. MDR is a complex multifactorial phenomenon, characterized by a decrease or abrogation of the efficacy of a wide spectrum of anticancer drugs that are structurally and mechanistically distinct. The overexpression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, notably ABCG2 and ABCB1, are one of the primary mediators of MDR in cancer cells, which promotes the efflux of certain chemotherapeutic drugs from cancer cells, thereby decreasing or abolishing their therapeutic efficacy. A number of studies have suggested that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), play a pivotal role in mediating the upregulation of ABC transporters in certain MDR cancer cells. This review will provide updated information about the induction of ABC transporters due to the aberrant regulation of ncRNAs in cancer cells. We will also discuss the measurement and biological profile of circulating ncRNAs in various body fluids as potential biomarkers for predicting the response of cancer patients to chemotherapy. Sequence variations, such as alternative polyadenylation of mRNA and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) at miRNA target sites, which may indicate the interaction of miRNA-mediated gene regulation with genetic variations to modulate the MDR phenotype, will be reviewed. Finally, we will highlight novel strategies that could be used to modulate ncRNAs and circumvent ABC transporter-mediated MDR.},

  abstract={Taking hearing loss as a prevalent sensory disorder, the restricted permeability of blood flow and the blood-labyrinth barrier in the inner ear pose significant challenges to transporting drugs to the inner ear tissues. The current options for hear loss consist of cochlear surgery, medication, and hearing devices. There are some restrictions to the conventional drug delivery methods to treat inner ear illnesses, however, different smart nanoparticles, including inorganic-based nanoparticles, have been presented to regulate drug administration, enhance the targeting of particular cells, and decrease systemic adverse effects. Zinc oxide nanoparticles possess distinct characteristics that facilitate accurate drug delivery, improved targeting of specific cells, and minimized systemic adverse effects. Zinc oxide nanoparticles was studied for targeted delivery and controlled release of therapeutic drugs within specific cells. XGBoost model is used on the Wideband Absorbance Immittance (WAI) measuring test after cochlear surgery. There were 90 middle ear effusion samples (ages = 1–10 years, mean = 34.9 months) had chronic middle ear effusion for four months and verified effusion for seven weeks. In this research, 400 sets underwent wideband absorbance imaging (WAI) to assess inner ear performance after surgery. Among them, 60 patients had effusion Otitis Media with Effusion (OME), while 30 ones had normal ears (control). OME ears showed significantly lower absorbance at 250, 500, and 1000 Hz than controls (p < 0.001). Absorbance thresholds >0.252 (1000 Hz) and >0.330 (2000 Hz) predicted a favorable prognosis (p < 0.05, odds ratio: 6). It means that cochlear surgery and WAI showed high function in diagnosis and treatment of inner ear infections. Regarding the R2 0.899 and RMSE 1.223, XGBoost shows excellent specificity and sensitivity for categorizing ears as having effusions absent or present or partial or complete flows present, with areas under the curve (1–0.944).},

  abstract={Drug resistance limits the efficacy of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM). However, the evolution of CRLM during drug treatment remains poorly elucidated. Multi-omics and treatment response data from 115 samples of 49 patients with CRLM undergoing bevacizumab (BVZ)-based chemotherapy show little difference in genomic alterations in 92% of cases, while remarkable differences are observed at the transcriptomic level. By decoupling intrinsic and acquired resistance, we find that hepatocyte and myeloid cell infiltration contribute to 38.5% and 23.1% of acquired resistance, respectively. Importantly, SMAD4 mutations and chr20q copy-number gain are associated with intrinsic chemoresistance. Gene interference experiments suggest that SMAD4R361H/C mutations confer BVZ and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance through STAT3 signaling. Notably, supplementing BVZ and 5-FU with the STAT3 inhibitor GB201 restores therapeutic efficacy in SMAD4R361H/C cancer cells. Our study uncovers the evolutionary dynamics of CRLM and its microenvironment during treatment and offers strategies to overcome drug resistance.},

  abstract={Gastric cancer is a significant health concern worldwide. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is associated with gastric cancer risk, but differences between HP-infected and HP-free gastric cancer have not been studied sufficiently. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of HP infection on the viability and migration of gastric cancer cells and identify potential underlying genetic mechanisms as well as their clinical relevance. Cell counting kit-8, lactate dehydrogenase, wound healing, and transwell assay were applied in the infection model of multiple clones of HP and multiple gastric cancer cell lines. Genes related to HP infection were identified using bioinformatics analysis and subsequently validated using real-time quantitative PCR. The association of these genes with immunity and drug sensitivity of gastric cancer was analyzed. Results showed that HP has no significant impact on viability but increases the migration of gastric cancer cells. We identified 1405 HP-upregulated genes, with their enriched terms relating to cell migration, drug, and immunity. Among these genes, the 82 genes associated with survival showed a significant impact on gastric cancer in consensus clustering and LASSO prognostic model. The top 10 hub HP-associated genes were further identified, and 7 of them were validated in HP-infected cells using real-time quantitative PCR, including ERBB4, DNER, BRINP2, KCTD16, MAPK4, THPO, and VSTM2L. The overexpression experiment showed that KCTD16 medicated the effect of HP on gastric cancer migration. Our findings suggest that HP infection may enhance the migratory potential of gastric cancer cells and these genes might be associated with immunity and drug sensitivity of gastric cancer. In human subjects with gastric cancer, HP presence in tumors may affect migration, immunity, and drug sensitivity.},

  abstract={The accurate identification of tissue origin in patients with metastatic cancer is critical for effective treatment selection but remains a challenge. The aim of this study is to develop a gene expression assay for tumor molecular classification and integrate it with clinicopathologic evaluations to identify the tissue origin for cancer of uncertain primary (CUP). A 90-gene expression signature, covering 21 tumor types, was identified and validated with an overall accuracy of 89.8% (95% CI, 0.87–0.92) in 609 tumor samples. More specifically, the classification accuracy reached 90.4% (95% CI, 0.87–0.93) for 323 primary tumors and 89.2% (95% CI, 0.85–0.92) for 286 metastatic tumors, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.71). Furthermore, in a real-life cohort of 141 CUP patients, predictions by the 90-gene expression signature were consistent or compatible with the clinicopathologic features in 71.6% of patients (101/141). Findings suggest that this novel gene expression assay could efficiently predict the primary origin for a broad spectrum of tumor types and support its diagnostic utility of molecular classification in difficult-to-diagnose metastatic cancer. Additional studies are ongoing to further evaluate the clinical utility of this novel gene expression assay in predicting primary site and directing therapy for CUP patients.},

Here, we analyze 5,592 prognostic lncRNAs in 9,446 cancers of 30 types using machine learning. We identify 166 lncRNAs whose expression correlates with survival and improves the accuracy of common clinical variables, molecular features, and cancer subtypes. Prognostic lncRNAs are often characterized by switch-like expression patterns. In low-grade gliomas, HOXA10-AS activation is a robust marker of poor prognosis that complements IDH1/2 mutations, as validated in another retrospective cohort, and correlates with developmental pathways in tumor transcriptomes. Loss- and gain-of-function studies in patient-derived glioma cells, organoids, and xenograft models identify HOXA10-AS as a potent onco-lncRNA that regulates cell proliferation, contact inhibition, invasion, Hippo signaling, and mitotic and neuro-developmental pathways.

  abstract={Esophageal cancer is mainly divided into esophageal adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). China is one of the high-incidence areas of esophageal cancer, of which about 90% are ESCC. The deubiquitinase USP38 has been reported to play significant roles in several biological processes, including inflammatory responses, antiviral infection, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, DNA damage repair, and chemotherapy resistance. However, the role and mechanisms of USP38 in ESCC development remain still unclear. Furthermore, although many substrates of USP38 have been identified, few upstream regulatory factors of USP38 have been identified. In this study, we found that USP38 was significantly upregulated in esophageal cancer tissues. Knockdown of USP38 inhibited ESCC growth. USP38 stabilized itself through auto-deubiquitylation. In addition, we demonstrate that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) could enhance the stability of USP38 protein and facilitate USP38 auto-deubiquitylation by interacting with USP38 in an RNA editing–independent manner. ADAR inhibition of ESCC cell proliferation depended on USP38. In summary, these results highlight that the potential of targeting the ADAR–USP38 axis for ESCC treatment.},

  abstract={Objective: Electronic health records (EHR), containing detailed longitudinal clinical information on a large number of patients and covering broad patient populations, open opportunities for comprehensive predictive modeling of disease progression and treatment response. However, since EHRs were originally constructed for administrative purposes not for research, in the EHR-linked studies, it is often not feasible to capture reliable information for analytical variables, especially in the survival setting, when both accurate event status and event times are needed for model building. For example, progression-free survival (PFS), a commonly used survival outcome for cancer patients, often involves complex information embedded in free-text clinical notes and cannot be extracted reliably. Proxies of PFS time such as time to the first mention of progression in the notes are at best good approximations to the true event time. This leads to difficulty in efficiently estimating event rates for an EHR patient cohort. Estimating survival rates based on error-prone outcome definitions can lead to biased results and hamper the power in the downstream analysis. On the other hand, extracting accurate event time information via manual annotation is time and resource intensive. The objective of this study is to develop a calibrated survival rate estimator using noisy outcomes from EHR data. Materials and Methods: In this paper, we propose a two-stage semi-supervised calibration of noisy event rate (SCANER) estimator that can effectively overcome censoring induced dependency and attains more robust performance (i.e., not sensitive to misspecification of the imputation model) by fully utilizing both a small-labeled set of gold-standard survival outcomes annotated via manual chart review and a set of proxy features automatically captured via EHR in the unlabeled set. We validate the SCANER estimator by estimating the PFS rates for a virtual cohort of lung cancer patients from one large tertiary care center and the ICU-free survival rates for COVID patients from two large tertiary care centers. Results: In terms of survival rate estimates, the SCANER had very similar point estimates compared to the complete-case Kaplan Meier estimator. On the other hand, other benchmark methods for comparison, which fail to account for the induced dependency between event time and the censoring time conditioning on surrogate outcomes, produced biased results across all three case studies. In terms of standard errors, the SCANER estimator was more efficient than the KM estimator, with up to 50% efficiency gain. Conclusion: The SCANER estimator achieves more efficient, robust, and accurate survival rate estimates compared to existing approaches. This promising new approach can also improve the resolution (i.e., granularity of event time) by using labels conditioning on multiple surrogates, particularly among less common or poorly coded conditions.},

The biopsies are usually obtained either via neurosurgical removal or stereotactic tissue biopsy, which can be risky procedures for the patient. To overcome these challenges, liquid biopsy has become an interesting option by constituting a safer procedure than conventional biopsy, which may offer valuable cellular and molecular information representative of the whole organism. Besides, it is relatively easy to obtain such as in the case of blood (venipuncture) and urine sample collection. In the present comprehensive review, we discuss the newest information regarding liquid biopsy in the brain tumors’ field, methods employed, the different sources of bio-fluids and their potential circulating targets.},

Materials and methods: Gene expression analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 on a multicentre retrospective training cohort of 128 patients and an independent validation cohort of 114 patients from the German Cancer Consortium - Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG). Genes were filtered based on differential gene expression analyses and Cox regression. The identified gene signature was combined with clinical parameters and with previously identified genes related to stem cells and hypoxia. Technical validation was performed using nanoString technology. Results: We identified a 6-gene signature consisting of four individual genes CAV1, GPX8, IGLV3-25, TGFBI, and one metagene combining the highly correlated genes INHBA and SERPINE1. This signature was prognostic for LRC on the training data (ci = 0.84) and in validation (ci = 0.63) with a significant patient stratification into two risk groups (p = 0.005). Combining the 6-gene signature with the clinical parameters T stage and tumour localisation as well as the cancer stem cell marker CD44 and the 15-gene hypoxia-associated signature improved the validation performance (ci = 0.69, p = 0.001). Conclusion: We have developed and validated a novel prognostic 6-gene signature for LRC of HNSCC patients with HPV-negative tumours treated by PORT-C. After successful prospective validation the signature can be part of clinical trials on the individualization of radiotherapy.},

  abstract={Background: Ovarian cancer (OV) is a common malignant tumor of the female reproductive system with a 5-year survival rate of ∼30 %. Inefficient early diagnosis and prognosis leads to poor survival in most patients. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, the largest family of human cell surface receptors) are associated with OV. We aimed to identify GPCR-related gene (GPCRRG) signatures and develop a novel model to predict OV prognosis. Method: We downloaded data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Prognostic GPCRRGs were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis, and a prognostic model was constructed. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated by Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analysis. The levels of GPCRRGs were examined in normal and OV cell lines using quantitative reverse-Etranscription polymerase chain reaction. The immunological characteristics of the high- and low-risk groups were analyzed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and CIBERSORT. Results: Based on the risks scores, 17 GPCRRGs were associated with OV prognosis. CXCR4, GPR34, LGR6, LPAR3, and RGS2 were significantly expressed in three OV datasets and enabled accurate OV diagnosis. K-M analysis of the prognostic model showed that it could differentiate high- and low-risk patients, which correspond to poorer and better prognoses, respectively. GPCRRG expression was correlated with immune infiltration rates. Conclusions: Our prognostic model elaborates on the roles of GPCRRGs in OV and provides a new tool for prognosis and immune response prediction in patients with OV.},

  abstract={Lung cancer represents one of the most prevalent malignant neoplasms, commanding an alarming incidence and mortality rate globally. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), constituting approximately 80 %-90 % of all lung cancer cases, is the predominant pathological manifestation of this disease, with a disconcerting 5-year survival rate scarcely reaching 10 %. Extensive prior investigations have elucidated that the aberrant expression of X-ray repair cross-complementing gene 2 (XRCC2), a critical meiotic gene intricately involved in the DNA damage repair process, is intimately associated with tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the precise roles and underlying mechanistic pathways of XRCC2 in NSCLC remain largely elusive. In the present study, we discerned an overexpression of XRCC2 within NSCLC patient tissues, particularly in high-grade samples, when juxtaposed with normal tissues. Targeted knockdown of XRCC2 notably impeded the proliferation of NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo. Comprehensive RNA sequencing and flow rescue assays unveiled that XRCC2 augments the proliferation of NSCLC cells through the down-regulation of FOS expression. Moreover, the c-Myc gene was definitively identified as an XRCC2 transcriptional factor by means of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays, whereby pharmacological attenuation of c-Myc expression, in conjunction with Doxorubicin, synergistically curtailed NSCLC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings proffer critical insights into the novel c-Myc-XRCC2-FOS axis in promoting both proliferation and resistance to Doxorubicin in NSCLC cells, thereby extending a promising avenue for potential new diagnostic strategies and therapeutic interventions in NSCLC.},

The current research aims to explore the role of CREB5 in multiple cancers. Methods: Pan-cancer analysis was performed to explore the expression patterns, prognostic value, mutational landscape as well as single-cell omic, immunologic, and drug sensitivity profiles of CREB5. Furthermore, we incorporated five distinct machine learning algorithms and determined that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-COX (LASSO-COX) algorithm, which exhibited the highest C index, was the optimal selection. Subsequently, we constructed a prognostic model centered around CREB5-associated genes. To elucidate the biological function of CREB5 in glioma cells, several assays including cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), wound healing, transwell, flow cytometric were performed. Results: CREB5 was overexpressed in pan-cancer and was linked to unfavorable prognosis, particularly in glioma. Furthermore, genetic alterations were determined in various types of cancer, and modifications in the CREB5 gene were linked to the prognosis. The single-cell omics and enrichment analyses showed that CREB5 was predominantly expressed in malignant glioma cells and was critically involved in the regulation of various oncogenic processes. Elevated levels of CREB5 were strongly linked with the infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and the Th1 subset of CD4+ T cells. The validated CREB5-associated prognostic model reliably predicted the prognosis and drug response of glioma patients. The in vitro experiments showed that CREB5 promoted glioma cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and gap phase 2/mitotic (G2/M) phase arrest and recruited M2 macrophages into glioma cells. Conclusion: CREB5 has the potential to act as an oncogene and a biological marker in multiple cancers, particularly glioma.},

  abstract={Lung cancer is the second most–frequently occurring cancer and the leading cause of cancer–associated deaths worldwide. Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common type of lung cancer is often diagnosed in middle or advanced stages and have poor prognosis. Diagnosis of disease at an early stage is a key factor for improving prognosis and reducing mortality, whereas, the currently used diagnostic tools are not sufficiently sensitive for early–stage NSCLC. The emergence of liquid biopsy has ushered in a new era of diagnosis and management of cancers, including NSCLC, since analysis of circulating tumor–derived components, such as cell–free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell–free RNAs (cfRNAs), exosomes, tumor–educated platelets (TEPs), proteins, and metabolites in blood or other biofluids can enable early cancer detection, treatment selection, therapy monitoring and prognosis assessment. There have been great advances in liquid biopsy of NSCLC in the past few years. Hence, this chapter introduces the latest advances on the clinical application of cfDNA, CTCs, cfRNAs and exosomes, with a particular focus on their application as early markers in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of NSCLC.},

  abstract={Background: The long-term fate of patients treated for resectable gastro-esophageal adenocarcinoma with perioperative chemotherapy outside randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is poorly described. In this national cohort, we report on outcomes after 12 years. Materials and methods: Baseline clinicopathological factors and blood tests were collected in 285 patients treated from May 2008 to June 2010, and postsurgical factors were collected in the 202 patients that were radically resected. Response to preoperative chemotherapy was assessed by postsurgical restaging. Additional information on second cancers, comorbidities, and competing causes of death was obtained. Results: Overall survival (OS) at 5 and 10 years was 31.9% and 24.2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis (MA) showed prognostic value of clinical T- and N-stage, dysphagia, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Elevated leucocytes and lactate dehydrogenase, and low lymphocytes were additional adverse prognostic factors. Ten-year incidence rate of second cancers was 10.1%. OS at 5 and 10 years from radical surgery was 43.1% and 32.1%, respectively. MA showed prognostic value of postneoadjuvant pathological (yp) Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage and downstaging. However, downstaging was strongly correlated with clinical stage. At the 5-year landmark, marginally significant trends toward a favorable recurrence-free survival were associated with ypT0 and age <70 years, but only 3.4% experienced late recurrences. Postoperative complications caused a quarter of deaths in the half of radically resected patients who died without recurrence. Conclusions: Five-year OS was 4%-6% points inferior to RCTs. Pretreatment white blood cell counts, but not postoperative, could supplement clinical prognostic factors. Downstaging by preoperative chemotherapy was prognostic but correlated strongly with pretreatment clinical stage.},

Immunotherapy has emerged as a crucial clinical treatment strategy for CC patients; however, the current methods and biomarkers are inadequate for accurately predicting immunotherapy responses and patient prognosis. This study comprehensively analyzed ferroptosis and cellular senescence, two processes intricately linked to tumorigenesis, progression, and therapy, utilizing multi-omics data from TCGA-CESC, GEO cohorts, and clinical data from CC patients. Based on ferroptosis- and cellular senescence -related patterns, two distinct clusters with divergent prognoses and tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics were identified. A prognostic model was subsequntly constructed, demonstrating robust reliability in predicting CC prognosis and response to immunotherapy. Patients in the low-risk group exhibited enriched immune cell infiltration, lower TIDE scores, higher IPS scores, and higher expression levels of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related genes, such as PDCD1 and CTLA4, which were associated with improved overall outcomes. Validation with clinical samples confirmed the differential expression of model-associated genes in CC, further supporting the model's accuracy. This prognostic model provides valuable insights into predicting CC prognosis and optimizing immunotherapy, offering potential benefits for personalized treatment strategies.},

Using unsupervised clustering, we identified five immunotypes with unique distributions of different cell types and gene expression profiles. An independent analysis of 17,800 open-source transcriptomes with the same approach corroborated these findings. Continuous immunotype-based signature scores were developed to correlate systemic immunity with patient responses to different cancer treatments, including immunotherapy, prognostically and predictively. Our approach and findings illustrate the potential utility of a simple blood test as a flexible tool for stratifying cancer patients into therapy response groups based on systemic immunoprofiling.},

However, their clinical application remains limited due to poor reproducibility and insufficient independent validation. Despite the availability of high-quality datasets, achieving reliable biomarker identification across multiple cohorts continues to be a significant challenge. To address these issues, we developed a comprehensive platform, SurvivalML, designed to support the discovery and validation of prognostic biomarkers and gene signatures using large-scale and harmonized data from 21 cancer types. Through SurvivalML, we identified DCLRE1B as a novel prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma, with experimental confirmation of its role in promoting tumor progression. Additionally, we developed the Chinese glioblastoma prognostic signature (CGPS) and its simplified version, SCGPS, a three-gene model. Both demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to other glioblastoma signatures in our in-house cohort and five independent Chinese datasets. The SCGPS model was further validated in 109 clinical samples using multiplex immunofluorescence, showing strong consistency with the original CGPS model. Overall, SurvivalML provides a robust platform for the identification and validation of prognostic biomarkers and gene signatures, offering a valuable resource for advancing cancer research and clinical application.},

  abstract={Effective isolation and in-depth analysis of Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs) are greatly needed in diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of the therapeutic response of cancer patients but have not been completely fulfilled by conventional approaches. The rarity of CTCs and the lack of reliable biomarkers to distinguish them from peripheral blood cells have remained outstanding challenges for their clinical implementation. Herein, we developed a high throughput Static Droplet Microfluidic (SDM) device with 38,400 chambers, capable of isolating and classifying the number of metabolically active CTCs in peripheral blood at single-cell resolution. Owing to the miniaturisation and compartmentalisation capability of our device, we first demonstrated the ability to precisely measure the lactate production of different types of cancer cells inside 125 pL droplets at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, we compared the metabolomic activity of leukocytes from healthy donors to cancer cells and showed the ability to differentiate them. To further prove the clinical relevance, we spiked cancer cell lines in human healthy blood and showed the possibility to detect the cancer cells from leukocytes. Lastly, we tested the workflow on 8 preclinical mammary mouse models including syngeneic 67NR (non-metastatic) and 4T1.2 (metastatic) models with Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) as well as transgenic mouses (12-week-old MMTV-PyMT). The results have shown the ability to precisely distinguish metabolically active CTCs from the blood using the proposed SDM device. The workflow is simple and robust which can eliminate the need for specialised equipment and expertise required for single-cell analysis of CTCs and facilitate on-site metabolic screening of cancer cells.},

  abstract={Introduction: Measuring the chromatin state of a tumor provides a powerful map of its epigenetic commitments; however, as these are generally bulk measurements, it has not yet been possible to connect changes in chromatin accessibility to the pathological signatures of complex tumors. In parallel, recent advances in computational pathology have enabled the identification of spatial features and immune cells within oral cavity tumors and their microenvironment. Methods: Here, we present pathogenomic fingerprinting (PaGeFin), a novel method that integrates morphological tumor features with chromatin states using ATAC-seq. This framework links spatial morphologic and epigenetic features, offering insights into tumor progression and immune evasion within and across tumors. Morphologic features describing spatial relationships between tumor and lymphocyte cells that are prognostic of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were identified through AI-driven pathology analysis. These pathomic features were spatially colocalized within the epigenome of 4 distinct sections of 4 OSCC tumors. Results: These key features pinpointed chromatin regions responsible for critical immune cell function through peak locations and enrichment analysis, highlighting loci of CD27+ memory B cells, helper CD4+ T cells, and cytotoxic CD8 naïve T cells that likely drive morphologic changes in the distribution of lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment and promote aggressive tumor behavior. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the CTLA4, CD79A, CD3D, and CCR7 genes were embedded in these regions. Conclusion: This computational approach is the first to assess the correlation between pathomic and epigenetic features in the context of cancer.},

Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD) plays a crucial role in tumor cell death and triggers a potent anti-tumor immune response. In this study, we report an ICD-related index (ICDR-Index) in NB through various machine learning methodologies, utilizing bulk transcriptome data from 1244 NB samples and 16 scRNA-seq datasets. Our results showed that the ICDR-Index could accurately identify different risk subtypes of patients with NB and provide predictive value for prognosis. Importantly, we found that high-risk patients with NB exhibited significantly poor overall survival (OS) rates, adverse clinical phenotypes, poor immune cell infiltration, and low sensitivity to immunotherapy. Furthermore, we identified ELAVL3 as a key gene within the ICDR-Index, where high expression levels were associated with malignancy and poor OS in NB. Additionally, targeted silencing of ELAVL3 down-regulated MYCN gene expression and reduced the malignancy of NB cells. Notably, the si-ELAVL3-transfected NB cells enhanced the anti-tumor activity of NK cells. Collectively, this study offers avenues for predicting the risk stratification of patients with NB and reveals a potential mechanism by which ELAVL3 regulates NB cell death.},

  abstract={Background: APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) family-mediated mutagenesis is widespread in human cancers. However, we still have a limited understanding of the biological features and clinical relevance of APOBEC mutagenesis in cancer, particularly in pancreatic cancer. Methods: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of various data, including whole-exome sequencing (WES), targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), transcriptome analysis (both bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq), immune profiling, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response, patient survival, and drug sensitivity. We used various bioinformatics and statistical methods to uncover the distributional features, microenvironmental changes, and clinical significance of APOBEC mutagenesis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Results: APOBEC mutagenesis significantly influenced mutation patterns in PAAD. Higher enrichment scores of APOBEC mutagenesis signature (APMs) were associated with survival prognosis, immune remodeling, and potential responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in PAAD patients. In pancreatic cancer, APOBEC3A and APOBEC1 played important roles in malignant progression and cell differentiation in the tumor microenvironment and mediated enhanced CAF-tumor cell communication in the microenvironment, while APMs were also involved in the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in pancreatic cancer through multiple pathways. Additionally, we developed and validated a machine learning model related to APOBEC mutagenesis across various cohorts of PAAD to predict poor survival prognosis. We also conducted drug sensitivity analyses to identify irinotecan as the drug with the highest inhibitory effect on APMs. Subsequently, in vitro experiments verified that irinotecan significantly inhibited pancreatic tumor cell proliferation. Our findings showed that irinotecan significantly reduced the proliferation, metastasis, and glycolysis of pancreatic tumor cells. It also decreased the expression levels of activation markers in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), including CD73, ACTA2, and COL1A1. In vivo experiments demonstrated that irinotecan could remodel the immune microenvironment by inhibiting Tregs, and combined with Treg inhibitors, it could effectively reduce the tumor burden of PAAD. Conclusion: Our study illustrated the characterization of APOBEC mutagenesis in multiple cancer types and highlighted its potential value as a prognostic and immunotherapeutic biomarker for PAAD, and finally demonstrated the effectiveness of irinotecan, an inhibitor of APMs, in vivo and in vitro experiments.},

To tackle this issue, we employed comprehensive bioinformatics to assess biological variations noticed among different TERT expression mechanisms. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) with pTERT MT (pTERT MT PTC) presented aggressive clinical behavior and exhibited biological profiles associated with cellular immortality and genomic instability. PTC with TERT expression but without pTERT MT (TERT (+) PTC), also exhibited poor clinicopathological characteristics and was enriched with immune responses. In accordance, c-MYC/E2F and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) were dominant transcription factors in pTERT MT PTC and TERT (+) PTC, respectively. Notably, we revealed TERT hypermethylated oncological region (THOR) as a potential TERT expressing mechanism in TERT (+) PTC patients. Furthermore, three unique subtypes of papillary thyroid cancer were deciphered using a combination of machine learning-based scoring systems. Our proposed scoring system was clinically significant, especially in microcarcinoma, predicting survival outcomes and inferring therapeutic responses to radioactive iodine therapy.

  abstract={Endometrial adenocarcinoma carries a bleak prognosis, and the molecular markers that evaluate the progression of endometrial adenocarcinoma to advanced stages remain uncertain. Cell–cell communication plays a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment. We aimed to explore the ligand–receptor relationship between tumor cells and other cells and construct a prognostic model. To make further investigation, we downloaded and analyzed datasets of single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptome sequencing for EC from GEO, bulk RNA sequencing and clinical data of TCGA-EC project from TCGA. Compared to the adjacent normal tissue, there is a significantly elevated Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling in the cell communication intensity and quantity of endometrial cancer tissues through analyzing the scRNA-seq dataset. Endometrial adenocarcinoma can be divided into four subtypes based on the OSM gene set. By comparing multiple machine learning methods, we have identified the random survival forest method as having the highest C-index. Based on this method, we constructed a seven-gene signature model to predict the survival prognosis of endometrial adenocarcinoma. The exogenous cytokine OSM induced Ishikawa cell proliferation and abnormal lipids metabolism, while the transcriptome sequencing results reveal that the pathways enriched with differentially expressed genes include AKT signaling pathways. The OSMR-knockout inhibited the tumorigenicity of Ishikawa Cells in the subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model of endometrial cancer. Our analysis revealed that OSM promotes the proliferation of Ishikawa cells via the AKT signaling pathway, abnormal lipids metabolism highlighting its significance in the regulation of TME. The prognostic model can provide valuable insights into guiding treatment strategies and suggesting further clinical management of endometrial adenocarcinoma patients.},

  abstract={Drug resistance poses a significant challenge in cancer treatment despite the clinical efficacy of cisplatin. Identifying and targeting biomarkers open new ways to improve therapeutic outcomes. In this study, comprehensive bioinformatic analyses were employed, including a comparative analysis of multiple datasets, to evaluate overall survival and mutation hotspots in 27 base excision repair (BER) genes of more than 7,500 tumors across 23 cancer types. By using various parameters influencing patient survival, revealing that the overexpression of 15 distinct BER genes, particularly PARP3, NEIL3, and TDG, consistently correlated with poorer survival across multiple factors such as race, gender, and metastasis. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses within protein-coding regions highlighted the potential deleterious effects of mutations on protein structure and function. The investigation of mutation hotspots in BER proteins identified PARP3 due to its high mutation frequency. Moving from bioinformatics to wet lab experiments, cytotoxic experiments demonstrated that the absence of PARP3 by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells increased drug activity towards cisplatin, carboplatin, and doxorubicin. Pathway analyses indicated the impact of PARP3 absence on the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and G-coupled signal pathways on cisplatin exposure. PDGF, a critical regulator of various cellular functions, was downregulated in the absence of PARP3, suggesting a role in cancer progression. Moreover, the influence of PARP3 knockdown on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) affects their function in the presence of cisplatin. In conclusion, the study demonstrated a synthetic lethal interaction between GPCRs, PDGF signaling pathways, and PARP3 gene silencing. PARP3 emerged as a promising target.},

The recurrence and metastasis of bladder cancer are closely related to angiogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we developed a method to predict survival outcomes among BLCA patients, which could be used to guide immunotherapy and chemotherapy. We obtained patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified angiogenesis-related genes from the GeneCards database. First, we used differential expression analysis and univariate Cox analysis to identify angiogenesis-related genes and used correlation analysis to generate molecular subtypes based on M2 macrophages. Next, we constructed a prognostic signature consisting of four genes (ECM1, EFEMP1, SLIT2, and PDGFRΑ), which was found to be an independent prognostic factor. Higher risk scores were associated with worse overall survival and higher expression of immune checkpoints. We also evaluated immune cell infiltration using the CIBERSORT and ssGSEA algorithms. Additionally, we performed stratification analyses, constructed a nomogram, and predicted chemotherapeutic responses based on the risk signature. Finally, we validated our findings by using qRT-PCR as well as IHC data to detect the expression levels of the four genes at mRNA and protein levels in BLCA patients and obtained results that were consistent with our predictions. Our study demonstrates the utility of a four-gene prognostic signature for prognostication in bladder cancer patients and designing personalized treatments, which could provide new avenues for personalized management of these patients.},

  abstract={Introduction: Reliable predictive markers are lacking for resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. The present study investigated the utility of SUVmax values acquired from PET/CT to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for resectable NSCLC. Materal and methods: SUVmax, clinical and pathological outcomes, were collected from patients in 5 hospitals. Patients who received dynamic PET/CT surveillance were divided into cohorts A (chemoimmunotherapy) and B (chemotherapy), respectively, while cohort C (chemoimmunotherapy) comprised patients undergoing post-therapy PET/CT. Associations between SUVmax and major pathologic response (MPR) were evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: A total of 129 cases with an MPR rate of 46.5 % was identified. In neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, ΔSUVmax% (AUC: 0.890, 95 % CI: 0.761–0.949) and post-therapy SUVmax (AUC: 0.933, 95 % CI: 0.802–0.959) could accurately predict MPR. On the contrary, the baseline SUVmax was not associated with MPR (p = 0.184). Furthermore, an independent cohort C proved that post-therapy SUVmax could serve as an independent predictor (AUC: 0.928, 95 % CI: 0.823–0.958). In addition, robust predictive performance could be observed when we use the optimal cut-off point of both ΔSUVmax% (54.4 %, AUC: 0.912, 95 % CI: 0.824–0.994) and post-therapy SUVmax (3.565, AUC: 0.912, 95 % CI: 0.824–0.994) in neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. The RNA data revealed that the expression of PFKFB4, a key enzyme in glycolysis, was positively correlated with SUVmax value and tumor cell proliferation after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. Conclusion: These findings highlighted that the ΔSUVmax% and remained SUVmax were accurate and non-invasive tests for the prediction of MPR after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.},

These conversations require frank disclosure of risks and benefits of the different treatment modalities in a way that is individualized for each patient and simple to understand. In most patients, breast conserving therapy with radiation should be presented as the gold-standard local treatment given similar long-term and improved quality of life outcomes. De-escalation is currently at the forefront of research in loco-regional treatments, and further investigations are required to best determine the optimal patient populations for reduced sentinel lymph node sampling, omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy altogether and omission of radiation treatment. For future trials, better endpoints need to be established considering patient-centered outcomes as well as recurrence.},

It has a very poor prognosis, is rapidly progressive, and has limited treatment options beyond empirical chemotherapy. Modern genomic advances play a role in identifying the primary tissue of origin (TOO) and in allowing molecular targeted therapies and immunotherapies to be used in the treatment of CUP patients. Whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing produce vast amounts of data, and predictive algorithms and artificial intelligence can be used to make this data clinically actionable. Recent trials have shown that using genomic data in clinical decision-making improves outcomes for CUP patients. Liquid biopsies are an exciting development that allow for repeated genomic analysis throughout treatment or when tissue is difficult to obtain. Genomics should be used routinely in the care of CUP patients, at diagnosis and to aid treatment decisions.},

However, the complete response rate to this modality remains relatively low, and current clinicopathologic and molecular classifications are inadequate to predict NAC response in patients with MIBC. Here, we demonstrate that dysregulation of the glutathione (GSH) pathway is fundamental for MIBC NAC resistance. Comprehensive analysis of the multicohort transcriptomes reveals that GSH metabolism and immune-response genes are enriched in NAC-resistant and NAC-sensitive MIBCs, respectively. A machine-learning-based tumor/stroma classifier is applied for high-throughput digitalized immunohistochemistry analysis, finding that GSH dynamics proteins, including glutaminase-1, are associated with NAC resistance. GSH dynamics is activated in cisplatin-resistant MIBC cells, and combination treatment with a GSH dynamics modulator and cisplatin significantly suppresses tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft animal model. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the predictive and therapeutic values of GSH dynamics in determining the NAC response in MIBCs.},

However, most of the current platforms show limited throughput due to design defects or lack of modules for high-speed data analysis, which greatly hampers the extraction of statistically unbiased biological data.

Utilizing machine learning and cross-validation techniques, we developed a model incorporating 12 genes that distinguish malignant cells from non-malignant ones. In vitro, we explored the effects of IGFBP2 knockdown on the proliferation, invasion, and migration of ESCC cells. The clinical relevance of IGFBP2 was confirmed through IHC and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Furthermore, using bioinformatics tools such as GSVA and xCell on public databases, we discovered that high expression of IGFBP2 is associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in ESCC, characterized by reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration. This was validated then through IHC. In summary, our study integrates single-cell sequencing and sophisticated computational techniques to highlight IGFBP2 as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target in ESCC.},

  abstract={Background: Precision oncology is gradually advancing into mainstream clinical practice, demonstrating significant survival benefits. However, eligibility and response rates remain limited in many cases, calling for better predictive biomarkers. Methods: We present ENLIGHT, a transcriptomics-based computational approach that identifies clinically relevant genetic interactions and uses them to predict a patient's response to a variety of therapies in multiple cancer types without training on previous treatment response data. We study ENLIGHT in two translationally oriented scenarios: personalized oncology (PO), aimed at prioritizing treatments for a single patient, and clinical trial design (CTD), selecting the most likely responders in a patient cohort. Findings: Evaluating ENLIGHT's performance on 21 blinded clinical trial datasets in the PO setting, we show that it can effectively predict a patient's treatment response across multiple therapies and cancer types. Its prediction accuracy is better than previously published transcriptomics-based signatures and is comparable with that of supervised predictors developed for specific indications and drugs. In combination with the interferon-γ signature, ENLIGHT achieves an odds ratio larger than 4 in predicting response to immune checkpoint therapy. In the CTD scenario, ENLIGHT can potentially enhance clinical trial success for immunotherapies and other monoclonal antibodies by excluding non-responders while overall achieving more than 90% of the response rate attainable under an optimal exclusion strategy. Conclusions: ENLIGHT demonstrably enhances the ability to predict therapeutic response across multiple cancer types from the bulk tumor transcriptome.

  abstract={Head and neck carcinoma (HNSC) is often diagnosed at advanced stage, incurring poor patient outcome. Despite of advances in chemoradiation and surgery approaches, limited improvements in survival rates of HNSC have been observed over the last decade. Accumulating evidences have demonstrated the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in carcinogenesis. In this context, we sought to identify a miRNA signature associated with the survival time in patients with HNSC. This study proposed a survival estimation method called HNSC-Sig that identified a miRNA signature consists of 25 miRNAs associated with the survival in 133 patients with HNSC. HNSC-Sig achieved 10-fold cross validation a mean correlation coefficient and a mean absolute error of 0.85 ± 0.01 and 0.46 ± 0.02 years, respectively, between actual and estimated survival times. The survival analysis revealed that five miRNAs, hsa-miR-3605-3p, hsa-miR-629-3p, hsa-miR-3127-5p, hsa-miR-497-5p, and hsa-miR-374a-5p, were significantly associated with prognosis in patients with HNSC. Comparing the relative expression difference of top 10 prioritized miRNAs, eight miRNAs, hsa-miR-629-3p, hsa-miR-3127-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-501-5p, hsa-miR-491-5p, hsa-miR-149-3p, hsa-miR-3934-5p, and hsa-miR-3170, were significantly expressed between cancer and normal groups. In addition, biological relevance, disease association, and target interactions of the miRNA signature were discussed. Our results suggest that identified miRNA signature have potential to serve as biomarker for diagnosis and clinical practice in HNSC.},

Despite important contributions made by cell models and clinical studies to tackle this problem, both present limitations when taken individually. Experiments with cell models are highly reproducible but do not reflect the indubitable heterogenous landscape of breast cancer. On the other hand, clinical studies account for this complexity but introduce uncontrolled noise due to external factors. Here, we propose a new approach for biomarker discovery that is based on a combined analysis of sequencing data from controlled MCF7 cell experiments and heterogenous clinical samples that include clinical and sequencing information from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Using data from differential gene expression analysis and a Bayesian logistic regression model coupled with an original simulated annealing-type algorithm, we discovered a novel 6-gene signature for stratifying patient response to hormone therapy. The experimental observations and computational analysis built on independent cohorts indicated the superior predictive performance of this gene set over previously known signatures of similar scope. Together, these findings revealed a new gene signature to identify patients with breast cancer with an increased risk of developing resistance to endocrine therapy.},

We have further developed an ensemble learning model that uses an XGBoost classifier and incorporates features to predict paralog gene pairs that influence immunotherapy efficacy. We experimentally validated the functional significance of these predicted paralog pairs using CRISPR double knockout (DKO). These data and analyses collectively provide a sensitive approach to identifying previously undetected paralog gene pairs that can significantly affect cancer immunotherapy response, even when individual genes within the pair have limited effect.},

  abstract={Objective: To investigate the value of pretreatment inflammatory-nutritional biomarkers in predicting the pathological response of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT). Methods: This retrospective study included eligible participants who underwent nCT followed by radical surgery. Pretreatment inflammatory nutritional biomarkers were calculated within one week prior to nCT. Correlations between biomarkers and pathological responses were analyzed. The cut-off values of the pretreatment biomarkers for predicting non-response were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The inflammation-nutrition score was calculated using the lymphocyte level, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI). Results: A total of 235 patients were retrospectively recruited between January 2017 and September 2022. Lower lymphocyte levels, lymphocyte monocyte ratio (LMR), and PNI, and higher NLR and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were observed in patients without response. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that NLR could independently predict non-response to nCT in patients with LARC. The sensitivity and specificity of the inflammation-nutrition score for predicting nonresponse were 71.2% and 61.7%, respectively. Conclusion: The pretreatment inflammation-nutrition score is a practical parameter for predicting nonresponse to nCT in patients with LARC. Patients with high scores were more likely to respond poorly to nCT.},

  abstract={Cancer remains a significant health concern due to its high mortality rates. Recent decades have witnessed substantial progress in cancer research, driven by advancements in high throughput sequencing technology and the application of diverse machine learning (ML) methods, particularly in the analysis of gene expression data. However, the proliferation of high-dimensional datasets, such as RNA-seq data, underscores the need for more robust ML techniques capable of efficiently handling large volumes of data to enable accurate treatment decisions. This paper introduces a novel hybrid feature selection (FS) algorithm, termed Game kernel SHapley Additive exPlanations (kSHAP), which combines with binary Social Ski Driver (bSSD), Adaptive Beta Hill Climbing (ABHC) and Late Acceptance Hill Climbing (LAHC) algorithms. The study comprehensively investigates three novel FS algorithms—kSHAP-bSSD, kSHAP-ABHC, and kSHAP-LAHC for cancer classification tasks using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets. An experiment conducted on five well-established RNA-seq cancer datasets: Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD), Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). The objective is to enhance cancer classification accuracy, robustness, and scalability using RNA-seq datasets. Additionally, the study evaluates six classifiers—Autoencoder (AE), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), and Random Forest (RF) with AE consistently out performing others. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, recall, precision, box plot, F1-score, radar plot, confusion matrix, ROC and statistical analysis. Our approach is compared against recent state-of-the-art FS algorithms, showing improvements in gene selection and classification accuracy. The kSHAP-bSSD demonstrates superior performance across all datasets compared to traditional methods, achieving an accuracy rate of 99.9% in LUAD and exhibiting higher accuracy rates and robustness in STAD, BRCA, LUSC, and UCEC datasets. Assessment across multiple metrics affirms the superiority of kSHAP-bSSD and kSHAP-ABHC combinations, underscoring their effectiveness in cancer classification tasks.},

  abstract={Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) shows variable response to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy, which can be partially explained by a combined positive score (CPS) of tumor and immune cell expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) within the local tumor microenvironment (TME). To better define TME immune determinants associated with treatment efficacy, we conduct a study of n = 48 HNSCC tumors from patients prior to pembrolizumab therapy. Our investigation combines a rapid bioorthogonal multiplex staining method with computational analysis of whole-slide imaging to capture the single-cell spatial heterogeneity and complexity of the TME. Analyzing 6,316 fields of view (FOVs), we provide comprehensive PD-L1 phenotyping and cell proximity assays across the entirety of tissue sections. While none of the PD-L1 metrics adequately predict response, we find that the spatial organization of CCR7+ dendritic cells (DCs) in niches better predicts overall patient survival than CPS alone. This study highlights the importance of understanding the spatial context of immune networks for immunotherapy.},

  abstract={Objectives: Neutrophils play a crucial part in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of a variety of cancers. Multi-omics approach was applied to explore the role of neutrophils in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and their influence on LUAD progression was characterized. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) database was accessed to obtain relevant data, based on which neutrophil subsets were identified after cell clustering and annotation using FindNeighbors and FindClusters. Monocle2 was utilized for Pseudotime analysis. Transcription factor (TF) prediction analysis was performed by applying pySCENIC. Hub genes identified by WGCNA were intersected with the genes screened by Cox regression to select key genes for LUAD. In addition, the expression and potential biological functions of the screened genes in LUAD were verified by conducting quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), wound healing, and transwell assays. Results: This study identified four neutrophil subsets, namely, Neu0, Neu1, Neu2, and Neu3. Pseudotime results revealed that the cells had five states, and cell communication analysis demonstrated a correlation between neutrophils and tumor cells. WGCNA analysis screened 381 hub genes, which were further compressed to 15 key genes. In vitro experiments validated the potential of the top five genes (P2RY13, CYTIP, ZYX, KLRB1, and HMOX1) to serve as biomarkers for LUAD. Knocking down HMOX1 effectively inhibited LUAD cell invasion and migration. Analysis of the prognostic models showed that the RiskScore and nomogram had strong prediction capabilities. Drug sensitivity analysis predicted vincristine as a potential drug for LUAD. Conclusions: This study identified five neutrophil-related biomarkers (P2RY13, CYTIP, ZYX, KLRB1, and HMOX1) for LUAD. Importantly, HMOX1 affected LUAD cell invasion and migration. The present findings improved the current understanding of the pathogenesis of LUAD.},

  abstract={Background: Glioblastoma is the most common type of glioma with a high incidence and poor prognosis, and effective medical treatment remains challenging. Pseudouridine (Ψ) is the first post-transcriptional modification discovered and one of the most abundant modifications to RNA. However, the prognostic value of Ψ-related lncRNAs (ΨrLs) for glioma patients has never been systematically evaluated. This study aims to construct a risk model based on ΨrLs signature and to validate the predictive efficiency of the model. Method: Transcriptomic data, genomic data, and relevant clinical data of glioma patients were extracted from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). ΨrLs with significant correlation with Ψ-related genes were identified, and univariate Cox regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and multivariate Cox regression were used to further select biomarkers and construct a ΨrLs signature risk model. Then, the expression of lncRNAs of ΨrLs signature in multiple glioma cell lines was detected by qPCR. Further, ROC analysis, stratification analysis, correlation analysis, survival analysis, nomogram, enrichment analysis, immune infiltration analysis, chemoradiotherapy sensitivity analysis, somatic mutation, and recurrent copy number variation (CNV) analysis were used to validate the predictive efficiency of ΨrLs signature in TCGA and CGGA datasets. Results: A four-lncRNA ΨrLs signature (DNAJC27-AS1, GDNF-AS1, ZBTB20-AS4, and DNMBP-AS1) risk model was constructed. By ROC analysis, stratified analysis, correlation analysis, survival analysis, and nomogram, the signature showed satisfactory predictive efficiency. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the differences in immune-related biological processes between high- and low-risk groups. Immune infiltration analysis showed that the high-risk group had lower tumor purity and higher stromal, immune and ESTIMATE scores. Mitoxantrone was identified as effective drug for low-risk group of glioma patients. Key genes in glioma development, including IDH1, EGFR, PTEN, etc., were differentially mutated between risk groups. The main recurrent CNVs in low-risk groups were 19q13.42 deletion and 7q34 amplification; 10q23.31 deletion and 12q14.1 in the high-risk group. Conclusions: Our study identified a four-lncRNA ΨrLs signature that effectively predicts the prognosis of glioma patients and may serve as a diagnostic tool. Risk scores of glioma patients generated by the signature is associated with immune-related biological processes and chemoradiotherapy sensitivity. These findings may inform the development of more targeted and effective therapies for glioma patients.},

Therefore, we aimed to make risk stratification for precise medicine. Methods: We performed a large next generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel on 44 patients with OCCC in FIGO stage II-IV. Then, by machine learning algorithms, including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random survival forest (RSF), and Cox regression, we screened for feature genes associated with prognosis and constructed a 5-gene panel for risk stratification. The prediction efficacy of the 5-gene panel was compared with FIGO stage and residual disease by receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis. Results: The feature mutated genes related to prognosis, selected by machine learning algorithms, include MUC16, ATM, NOTCH3, KMT2A, and CTNNA1. The 5-gene panel can effectively distinguish the prognosis, as well as platinum response, of advanced OCCC in both internal and external cohorts, with the predictive capability superior to FIGO stage and residual disease. Conclusions: Mutations in genes, including MUC16, ATM, NOTCH3, KMT2A, and CTNNA1, were associated with the poor prognosis of advanced OCCC. The risk stratification according to these genes demonstrated acceptable prediction power of prognosis and platinum response, suggesting the potential to be a novel target for precision medicine.},

  abstract={Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy, and patients often have different responses to treatment. In this study, the genetic characteristics related to exosome formation and secretion procedure were used to predict chemoresistance and guide the individualized treatment of patients. Methods: Firstly, seven microarray datasets in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and RNA-Seq dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to analysis the transcriptome profiles and associated characteristics of CRC patients. Then, a predictive model based on gene features linked to exosome formation and secretion was created and validated using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) machine learning. Finally, we evaluated the model using chemoresistant/chemosensitive cells and tissues by immunofluorescence (IF), western blot (WB), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry (IHC) experiments, and the predictive value of integrated model in the clinical validation cohort were performed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves analyses. Results: We established a risk score signature based on three genes related to exosome secretion in CRC. Better Overall Survival (OS) and greater chemosensitivity were seen in the low-risk group, whereas the high-risk group exhibited chemoresistance and a subpar response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Higher expression of the model genes EXOC2, EXOC3 and STX4 were observed in chemoresistant cells and specimens. The AUC of 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 0.804. Compared with that in the low-risk group, patients' DFS was found to be significantly worse in the high-risk group. Conclusions: In summary, the gene signature related to exosome formation and secretion could reliably predict patients' chemosensitivity and ICB treatment response, which providing new independent biomarkers for the treatment of CRC.},

  abstract={Current clinical factors for screening candidates that might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer are inadequate. Tumor microenvironment, especially the stromal components, has the potential to determine treatment response. However, clinical translation of the tumor-associated stromal characterization into a practical biomarker for helping treatment decision has not been established. Using machine learning, we established a novel 31-gene signature, called stromal cell infiltration intensity score (SIIS), to distinguish patients characterized by the enrichment of abundant stromal cells in five colon cancer datasets from GEO (N = 990). Patients with high-SIIS were at higher risk for recurrence and mortality, and could not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy due to their intrinsic drug resistance; however, the opposite was reported for patients with low-SIIS. The role of SIIS in detection of patients with high stromal cell infiltration and reduced drug efficiency was consistently validated in the TCGA-COAD cohort (N = 382), Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center cohort (N = 30), and could also be observed in TCGA pan-cancer settings (N = 4898) and four independent immunotherapy cohorts (N = 467). Based on multi-omics data analysis and the CRISPR library screen, we reported that lack of gene mutation, hypomethylation in ADCY4 promoter region, activation of WNT-PCP pathway and SIAH2-GPX3 axis were potential mechanisms responsible for the chemoresistance of patients within high-SIIS group. Our findings demonstrated that SIIS provide an important reference for those making treatment decisions for such special patients.},

With advancements in multiomics technology, the exploration of cancers related to immunity, stemness, and the DDR has triggered interest, but the combination of these levels for analyzing multiple cancers remains insufficient. Methods: In this study, 9906 solid tumor samples from 31 TCGA cancer types were clustered on the basis of the enrichment levels of 13 gene sets associated with stemness, immunity, and DDR. Moreover, a soft ensemble model was constructed on the basis of the enrichment levels of these 13 gene sets to predict cancer subtypes via other omics data. Results: We identified four pancancer subtypes, termed C1, C2, C3, and C4, which presented distinct molecular and clinical features, including the immune microenvironment, stemness, genome instability, intratumor heterogeneity, methylation levels, tumor progression, sensitivity to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and survival prognosis. The soft ensemble model validated this subtyping method in two breast cancer datasets (gene expression level), a pancancer proteomic dataset (protein expression level), and a pancancer cell line dataset (cell line gene expression level). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that immune, stemness, and DDR signature-based subtyping offers new perspectives on cancer biology and holds promise for improving the clinical management of cancers.},

Materials and methods: Patients with stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and surgery were eligible. Patients underwent multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced) before CRT, during CRT (week 3) and after CRT (1 week prior to surgery). Whole tumour apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and Ktrans histogram quantiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th) were extracted for analysis. The associations between ADC and Ktrans at three timepoints with time to relapse were analysed as a continuous variable using a Cox proportional hazard model. Results: Thirty-three patients were included in this analysis. The median follow-up was 4.4 years. No patient had locoregional relapse. Nine patients developed distant metastases. The hazard ratios for after CRT Ktrans 10th (P = 0.035), 25th (P = 0.048), 50th (P = 0.046) and 75th (P = 0.045) quantiles were statistically significant for DFS. The best Ktrans cut-off point after CRT for predicting relapse was 28 × 10−3 mL/g/min (10th quantile), with a higher Ktrans value predicting distant relapse. The 4-year DFS probability was 0.93 for patients with after CRT Ktrans value ≤28 × 10−3 mL/g/min versus 0.45 for patients with after CRT Ktrans value >28 × 10−3 mL/g/min. ADC was not able to predict DFS. Conclusions: Patients with higher Ktrans values after CRT (before surgery) in a histogram analysis of whole tumour heterogeneity had a significantly lower 4-year distant DFS and could be considered for more intense systemic therapy.},

Results: A total of 94 DE-NRGs were recognized here, among which, FAM166B, NEFL, POLDIP3, PRSS37, and ZNF594 were authenticated as necroptosis-related biomarkers, and the linear regression model based on them presented an acceptable ability to different sample types. Following regulatory analysis, the ascertained biomarkers were markedly abundant in functions pertinent to blood circulation, calcium ion homeostasis, and the MAPK/cAMP/Ras signaling pathway. Single-sample GSEA exhibited that APC co-stimulation and CCR were more abundant, and aDCs and B cells were relatively scarce in CHD patients. Consistent findings from bioinformatics and qRT-PCR analyses confirmed the upregulation of NEFL and the downregulation of FAM166B, POLDIP3, and PRSS37 in CHD. Conclusion: Our current investigation identified 5 necroptosis-related genes that could be diagnostic markers for CHD and brought a novel comprehension of the latent molecular mechanisms of necroptosis in CHD.},

  abstract={Considering the high incidence of osteoarthritis (OA), especially of the knee and hip, this study explores the possible genetic associations between OA and cancer types, including cancers of the bladder, kidney, breast, and prostate. The objective of our study is to decipher the complex genetic connections among these common disorders, emphasizing potential correlations and underlying biological processes. However, the genetic connections between these diseases remain largely unexplored. It fills a vacuum in the literature by using a new clustering approach based on Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO-C), which is a first for applying machine learning methods to this particular set of genetic data. To address this gap, we introduce HHO-C, a novel machine learning-based clustering approach, for the first time in this specific genetic dataset. The work accomplishes three noteworthy firsts: firstly, it is the first to apply machine learning to the study of the genetic interactions between OA and these cancers. Second, it creates a flexible genetic dataset that will be very helpful for further studies in this field. Finally, it presents the novel HHO-C approach, showcasing how well it manages intricate genetic data and providing fresh perspectives on genetic data analysis. It is anticipated that the results of this investigation will clarify the genetic relationships between OA and these malignancies, which could result in novel understandings of medical genetics and the creation of fresh approaches to diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract={Cervical cancer remains a major cause of mortality, particularly in low-resource settings where traditional cytology-based screening faces challenges such as limited infrastructure and trained personnel. To address this, we present a terahertz (THz) graphene-enhanced metasurface biosensor enabling rapid, label-free detection of cervical cancer biomarkers without complex sample preparation or expensive labs. Using finite element method (FEM) simulations, we demonstrate that tuning graphene's chemical potential from 0.1 to 0.9 eV significantly modulates peak absorption from 0.223 to 1.316, providing a wide dynamic range for sensitive detection across varying sample concentrations. The sensor exhibits robust angular stability, with absorption increasing from 0.546 to 1.306 as the incident light angle shifts from 0° to 80°, ensuring reliable performance without precise optical alignment. Refractive index sensing experiments reveal frequency shifts of 50 GHz and consistently high absorption (55.16 %–56.54 %), achieving a sensitivity of 300 GHz per refractive index unit (RIU) and a figure of merit of 12 RIU−1. To enhance diagnostic accuracy, we integrated an XGBoost machine learning algorithm that analyzes the complex spectral data, achieving 86 % prediction accuracy with low error rates. This combination of advanced sensing and AI-assisted analysis offers a promising, cost-effective solution for cervical cancer screening in resource-limited environments.},

  abstract={Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly invasive brain tumor of astrocytic origin. Nitrogen metabolism plays an instrumental role in the growth and progression of various tumors, including GBM. This study intended to mine nitrogen metabolism-related biomarkers for GBM-related research of prognosis and immunotherapy. Through single-cell data analysis of GBM, we identified four cell types (Astrocytes, Macrophages, Fibroblasts, and Endothelial cells). We calculated the nitrogen metabolism scores and conducted trajectory analysis for the most abundant cells, Astrocytes, revealing 6 differentiation directions of Astrocytes, which included the main differentiation direction from cells with low nitrogen metabolism scores to cells with high nitrogen metabolism scores. Furthermore, based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with high/low nitrogen metabolism scores, we constructed a 7-gene prognostic model by utilizing regression analysis. qRT-PCR analysis showed that IGFBP2, CHPF, CTSZ, UPP1, TCF12, ZBTB20 and RBP1 were all significantly up-regulated in the GBM cells. Through differential analysis, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and enrichment analyses, we identified and analyzed the DEGs in the high RiskScore subgroup, revealing complex interactions among DEGs, which were mainly related to pathways such as TNF signaling pathway and NF-κB signaling pathway. By leveraging univariate analysis, survival-related genes were selected from the nitrogen metabolism-related gene sets. Clustering, survival, immune, and mutation analyses manifested that the collected nitrogen metabolism-related genes had good classification performance, presenting notable differences in survival rates, immune levels, gene mutations, and sensitivity to drugs between cluster1 and cluster2. In conclusion, the project investigated the prognosis and classification value of nitrogen metabolism-related genes in GBM from multiple perspectives, predicting the sensitivity of different subtypes of patients to immunotherapy response and drug sensitivity. These findings are expected to show new research directions for further exploration in these fields.},

  abstract={Background: Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, characterized by significant inter-patient heterogeneity and poor long-term prognosis. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, has emerged as a promising avenue for cancer therapy, yet its role in UVM remains insufficiently explored. Methods: We systematically screened ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) associated with UVM prognosis by integrating univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and Random Forest algorithms. A prognostic signature was constructed and validated using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus cohorts. We further evaluated the model's association with clinicopathological features, tumor immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity. In vitro experiments were conducted to validate the functional role of SIRT3, the most pivotal gene in the signature. Results: A robust FRG-based prognostic model comprising SIRT3, RRM2, and PANX2 was developed and successfully stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes. Multivariate Cox regression confirmed the risk score as an independent prognostic factor. High-risk patients exhibited immunosuppressive microenvironmental features, including elevated regulatory T cells and macrophage infiltration, as well as lower predicted response to immune checkpoint blockade. Drug sensitivity analysis identified ten compounds with lower predicted IC50 values in the high-risk group, suggesting potential therapeutic relevance. Functional assays demonstrated that SIRT3 knockdown promoted UVM cell proliferation and migration, while attenuating susceptibility to ferroptosis, highlighting its tumor-suppressive role. Conclusion: This study presents a novel FRG signature with strong prognostic and immunological implications in UVM. The model offers a promising tool for risk stratification and may assist in guiding ferroptosis- and immunotherapy-based precision treatment. Our findings also suggest that SIRT3 acts as a ferroptosis sensitizer in UVM, representing a potential therapeutic target warranting further investigation.},

Here, we address this barrier by applying five different machine learning approaches to multi-omic data from 8,791 TCGA tumor samples comprising 106 subtypes from 26 different cancer cohorts to build models based upon small numbers of features that can classify new samples into previously defined TCGA molecular subtypes—a step toward molecular subtype application in the clinic. We validate select classifiers using external datasets. Predictive performance and classifier-selected features yield insight into the different machine-learning approaches and genomic data platforms.

Routine HRD testing relies on identifying BRCA mutations, but additional HRD-positive patients can be identified by measuring genomic instability (GI), a consequence of HRD. However, the cost and complexity of available solutions hamper GI testing. We introduce a deep learning framework, GIInger, that identifies GI from HRD-induced scarring observed in low-pass whole-genome sequencing data. GIInger seamlessly integrates into standard BRCA testing workflows and yields reproducible results concordant with a reference method in a multisite study of 327 ovarian cancer samples. Applied to a BRCA wild-type enriched subgroup of 195 PAOLA-1 clinical trial patients, GIInger identified HRD-positive patients who experienced significantly extended progression-free survival when treated with PARPi. GIInger is, therefore, a cost-effective and easy-to-implement method for accurately stratifying patients with ovarian cancer for first-line PARPi treatment.},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: To develop an explainable fusion model that combines clinical, radiomic, and habitat features to predict postoperative early recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The bicentric retrospective study included 370 patients with surgically confirmed early-stage HCC who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. The patients were stratified into a training cohort (n = 296) and an external validation cohort (n = 74). From the hepatobiliary phase images, habitat and radiomics features were extracted across the entire tumor and used to construct radiomics and habitat models. Additionally, a clinical model was established utilizing relevant clinical features. Subsequently, all previously mentioned features were merged to construct the fusion model (HabRad_FB). Diagnostic performance of these models was assessed and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). The fusion model was then interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Results: Tumor recurrence was observed in 73 out of 370 patients (19.7%; 55.2 ± 11.3 years; male = 333). Among all study cohorts, the HabRad_FB model showed the highest AUC (0.820–0.959), outperforming the clinical (0.517–0.729), radiomics (0.707–0.815), and habitat (0.729–0.861) models. The HabRad_FB model also demonstrated significant improvement in IDI in the training cohort and NRI in the validation cohort. SHAP force plots provided valuable insights into the interpretation of HabRad_FB model's predictions for early recurrence. Conclusion: The HabRad_FB, an explainable fusion model, aids clinicians in accurately and non-invasively predicting the early recurrence of HCC preoperatively. This model might provide great potential in prognostic prediction and clinical management.},

  abstract={Objective: Elastography images tissue mechanical responses and infers the underlying properties to aid diagnosis and treatment response monitoring. The estimation of absolute or relative tumor properties may vary with dimensions even when the mechanical properties remain constant. Harmonic motion imaging (HMI) uses amplitude-modulated (AM) focused ultrasound to interrogate the targeted tissue's viscoelastic properties. In this study, effects of AM frequencies on HMI were investigated in terms of inclusion relative stiffness and size estimation. Methods: AM frequencies from 200 to 600 Hz in steps of 100 Hz were considered using a 5.3-kPa phantom with cylindrical inclusions (Young's modulus: 22, 31, 44, 56 kPa, and diameter: 4.8, 8.1, 13.6, 19.8 mm) to optimize the performance of HMI in characterizing tumors with the same mechanical properties and of different dimensions. Results: Consistent displacement ratios (DRs) (17.5% variation) of the inclusion to background were obtained with 200-Hz AM for breast-tumor-mimicking inclusions albeit a suboptimal inclusion size estimation obtained. 400-Hz was otherwise used for small and low-contrast inclusions (4.8 mm, 22 or 31 kPa). A linear relationship (R2 = 0.9043) was found between the inverse DR at these frequencies and the Young's modulus ratio. 400 Hz obtained the most accurate inclusion size estimation with an overall estimation error on the lateral dimension of 0.5 mm. In vivo imaging of breast cancer patients (n = 5) was performed at 200 or 400 Hz. Conclusion: The results presented herein indicate that the HMI AM frequency could be optimized adaptively in cases of different applications, i.e., at 200 or 400 Hz, depending on whether aimed for consistent DR measurement for tumor response assessment or tumor margin delineation for surgical planning. HMI may thus be capable of predicting the pathologic endpoint of tumors in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) as early as 3 weeks into treatment.},

Validation through computer simulations and in vitro studies demonstrated the good accuracy of EXCHANGE-derived metrics. In a proof-of-concept study, EXCHANGE was applied to animal models and patients with triple-negative breast cancer, showcasing its potential to evaluate tumor therapeutic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Advanced omics and multi-view clustering algorithms present unprecedented opportunities for classifying cancers into subtypes, refining survival predictions and treatment outcomes, and unravelling key pathophysiological processes across various molecular layers. However, with the increasing availability of cost-effective high-throughput technologies (HTT) that generate vast amounts of data, analyzing single layers often falls short of establishing causal relations. Integrating multi-omics data spanning genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, and microbiomes offers unique prospects to comprehend the underlying biology of complex diseases like cancer. This discussion explores algorithmic frameworks designed to uncover cancer subtypes, disease mechanisms, and methods for identifying pivotal genomic alterations. It also underscores the significance of multi-omics in tumor classifications, diagnostics, and prognostications. Despite its unparalleled advantages, the integration of multi-omics data has been slow to find its way into everyday clinics. A major hurdle is the uneven maturity of different omics approaches and the widening gap between the generation of large datasets and the capacity to process this data. Initiatives promoting the standardization of sample processing and analytical pipelines, as well as multidisciplinary training for experts in data analysis and interpretation, are crucial for translating theoretical findings into practical applications.},

  abstract={Cancer treatment often fails because combinations of different therapies evoke complex resistance mechanisms that are hard to predict. We introduce REsistance through COntext DRift (RECODR): a computational pipeline that combines co-expression graph networks of single-cell RNA sequencing profiles with a graph-embedding approach to measure changes in gene co-expression context during cancer treatment. RECODR is based on the idea that gene co-expression context, rather than expression level alone, reveals important information about treatment resistance. Analysis of tumors treated in preclinical and clinical trials using RECODR unmasked resistance mechanisms –invisible to existing computational approaches– enabling the design of highly effective combination treatments for mice with choroid plexus carcinoma, and the prediction of potential new treatments for patients with medulloblastoma and triple-negative breast cancer. Thus, RECODR may unravel the complexity of cancer treatment resistance by detecting context-specific changes in gene interactions that determine the resistant phenotype.},

  abstract={Cancer-associated fibroblasts paly critical roles in regulating cancer cell biological properties by intricate and dynamic communication networks. But the mechanism of CAFs in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is not clear. In our study, we identified CAFs and malignant cells from the integrated scRNA-seq datasets and establish a CAF-derived communication signature based on the highly activated regulons ETS1 and MEF2C. We stratified the ccRCC TME into two molecular subtypes with distinct prognoses, immune cell infiltration landscapes, and immune-related characteristics. The model derived from signature demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in predicting prognosis and ICIs therapy responses. Subsequently, the SLC38A5 of the model was found upregulated in CAFs and was related to decreased survival probabilities, inflamed TME, and upregulated inhibitory checkpoints. SLC38A5 inhibition could attenuate the pro-tumoral abilities of CAFs in terms of proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanically, CCL5 could restore these properties induced by SLC38A5 inhibition. In conclusion, our communication signature and its derived model enabled a more precise selection of ccRCC patients who were potential beneficiaries of ICIs. Besides, the SLC38A5-CCL5 axis may serve as a promising target for ccRCC treatment.},

  abstract={Objective: To establish nomograms integrating multiparametric MRI radiomics with clinical-radiological features to identify the responders and non-responders to induction chemotherapy (ICT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and MRI data of 168 NPC patients between December 2015 and April 2022. We used 3D-Slicer to segment the regions of interest (ROIs) and the “Pyradiomic” package to extract radiomics features. We applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression to select radiomics features. We developed clinical-only, radiomics-only, and the combined clinical-radiomics nomograms using logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic curves, DeLong test, calibration, and decision curves were used to assess the discriminative performance of the models. The model was internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Results: A total of 14 optimal features were finally selected to develop a radiomic signature, with an AUC of 0.891 (95 % CI, 0.825–0.946) in the training cohort and 0.837 (95 % CI, 0.723–0.932) in the testing cohort. The nomogram based on the Rad-Score and clinical-radiological factors for evaluating tumor response to ICT yielded an AUC of 0.926 (95 % CI, 0.875–0.965) and 0.901 (95 % CI, 0.815–0.979) in the two cohorts, respectively. Decision curves demonstrated that the combined clinical-radiomics nomograms were clinically useful. Conclusion: Nomograms integrating multiparametric MRI-based radiomics and clinical-radiological features could non-invasively discriminate ICT responders from non-responders in NPC patients.},

  abstract={Background: The skeletal muscle index (SMI) can serve as a surrogate for a patient's nutritional status, which is associated with treatment toxicity. This study aims to investigate the potential of baseline skeletal muscle radiomics features to predict gastrointestinal toxicity of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer. Methods: A total of 214 rectal cancer patients (115, 49 and 50 in the training, internal and external validation set, respectively) who underwent neoadjuvant pelvic radiotherapy with capecitabine and irinotecan were retrospectively identified. The skeletal muscle at the level of the third lumber vertebra was contoured, and the radiomics features were extracted from computed tomography scans. In the training set, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm was applied to select features that were most significantly associated with grade 3–4 gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and proctitis). The predictive performance and clinical utility were estimated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), F1-score and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: Nine features, including the SMI and eight radiomics features, were associated with grade 3–4 gastrointestinal toxicity and included in the logistic regression. This combined predictive model, which incorporated the SMI and radiomics features, showed better discrimination than the SMI alone, with an AUC of 0.856 (95 % CI: 0.782–0.929) in the training cohort, 0.812 (95 % CI: 0.667–0.956) in the internal validation cohort and 0.745 (95 % CI: 0.600–0.890) in the external validation cohort. DCA further verified the clinical utility of the combined predictive model. Conclusion: Radiomics features of skeletal muscle were significantly associated with gastrointestinal toxicity. The predictive model incorporating the SMI and radiomics features exhibits favorable discrimination and may be highly informative for clinical decision-makings.},

  abstract={Background and purpose: We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of peritumoral and intratumoral computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics during the course of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer (LHC). Materials and methods: A total of 92 eligible patients were 1:1 randomly assigned into training and validation cohorts. Pre-RT and mid-RT radiomic features were extracted from pre-treatment and interim CT. LASSO–Cox regression was used for feature selection and model construction. Time-dependent area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) analysis was applied to evaluate the models’ prognostic performances. Risk stratification ability on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed using the Kaplan–Meier method and Cox regression. The associations between radiomics and clinical parameters as well as circulating lymphocyte counts were also evaluated. Results: The mid-RT peritumoral (AUC: 0.77) and intratumoral (AUC: 0.79) radiomic models yielded better performance for predicting OS than the pre-RT intratumoral model (AUC: 0.62) in validation cohort. This was confirmed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, in which risk stratification depended on the mid-RT peritumoral (p = 0.009) and intratumoral (p = 0.003) radiomics could be improved for OS, in comparison to the pre-RT intratumoral radiomics (p = 0.199). Multivariate analysis identified mid-RT peritumoral and intratumoral radiomic models as independent prognostic factors for both OS and PFS. Mid-RT peritumoral and intratumoral radiomics were correlated with treatment-related lymphopenia. Conclusion: Mid-RT peritumoral and intratumoral radiomic models are promising image biomarkers that could have clinical utility for predicting OS and PFS in patients with LHC treated with RT.},

  abstract={Background: The tumour stroma is associated with unfavourable prognosis in diverse solid tumours, but its prognostic and predictive value in bladder cancer (BCa) is unclear. Methods: In this multicentre, retrospective study, we included 830 patients with BCa from six independent cohorts. Differences in overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were investigated between high-tumour stroma ratio (TSR) and low-TSR groups. Multi-omics analyses, including RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing, were performed to study stroma-immune interactions. TSR prediction models were developed based on pelvic CT scans, and the best performing model was selected based on receiver operator characteristic analysis. Findings: Compared to low-TSR tumours, high-TSR tumours were significantly associated with worse OS (HR = 1.193, 95% CI: 1.046–1.361, P = 0.008) and CSS (HR = 1.337, 95% CI: 1.139–1.569, P < 0.001), and lower rate of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). High-TSR tumours exhibited higher infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, including Tregs and tumour-associated neutrophils, while low-TSR tumours exhibited higher infiltration of immune-activating cells such as CD8+ Teff and XCR1+ dendritic cells. The TSR prediction model was developed by combining the intra-tumour and tumour base radiomics features, and showed good performance to predict high-TSR, as indicted by area under the curve of 0.871 (95% CI: 0.821–0.921), 0.821 (95% CI: 0.731–0.911), and 0.801 (95% CI: 0.737–0.865) in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. In patients with low predicted TSR, 92.3% (12/13) achieved pCR, while only 35.3% (6/17) of patients with high predicted TSR achieved pCR. Interpretation: The tumour stroma was found to be significantly associated with clinical outcomes in patients with BCa as a result of tumour stroma-immune interactions. The radiomics prediction model provided non-invasive evaluation of TSR and was able to predict pCR in patients receiving NAC for BCa.

  abstract={Background: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) from Breast cancer (BC) is commonly seen in BC progression. Currently, the identification of genes linked with LNM in BC remains in mystery. Methods: Genes related to BC LNM were screened, and a risk model was constructed based on LASSO-Cox analysis. Combined with the Kaplan-Meier curve, the ability of riskscore to distinguish different baseline characteristics was evaluated, and model was verified by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The expression levels of prognostic marker genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blot (WB). Results: A higher survival rate and longer survival time in low-risk BC patients. The 1, 3 and 5 year AUC values of the training set were 0.79, 0.74, and 0.73, respectively. Results for the validation set was similar to the training set. The differentially expressed genes between the high- and low-risk groups were significantly enriched in immune pathways. In addition, the low-risk group had higher levels of immune infiltration. qRT-PCR and WB results showed that in BC, CDH10, SMR3A, POU3F2, and FABP7 were down-regulated, and LHX1 was up-regulated. Conclusions: We built a prognostic model of BC based on LNM-related genes, proffering evaluation for prognosis and precise cure of BC. Significance: At present, the genes related to lymph node metastasis in BC are still largely unknown and need to be further explored. Searching for potential lymph node metastasis-related genes of BC will provide meaningful biomarkers for BC treatment. Based on TCGA-BRCA data, we established an effective 11-gene prognostic risk model that could predict patient outcomes independently. Our model could classify BC patients and distinguish patients with poor prognosis effectively. Besides, the feature genes we identified might exert a predictive function in immunotherapy. The results of this study provide a new reference for the prognosis and treatment of BC patients with lymph node metastasis.},

  abstract={Monitoring cancer therapy is difficult because of restricted imaging depth, inadequate molecular specificity, and delayed response evaluation. Moreover, conventional imaging techniques fail to provide high-resolution, real-time views of the dynamic tumor microenvironment during therapy. Among emerging technologies, nanophotonic photoacoustic biosensors have gained prominence as multifunctional platforms that enable real-time, non-invasive imaging and dynamic monitoring of cancer therapy. This review discusses advances in nanophotonic engineering, including plasmonic nanostructures, NIR-II fluorophore-integrated systems, SERS-active materials, fiber-optic probes, and hybrid nanosystems, all tailored to enhance molecular targeting and signal specificity. In addition, biomimetic and biologically inspired nanosystems with enhanced tissue penetration and reduced autofluorescence in the NIR-II spectrum can be specifically highlighted. The key aspects of clinical translation are examined including biosafety, molecular specificity, and scalability. Furthermore, further explore the convergence of these biosensors with artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks to support adaptive, patient-specific decision-making in oncology. As a result of these multifunctional systems that combine nanophotonics, machine learning, and molecular diagnostics, oncology could shift towards precision-guided treatment. Finally, it proposes strategic avenues for clinical adoption, placing PAS at the vanguard of the next generation of cancer diagnostics.},

  abstract={The integration of different imaging modalities, such as structural, diffusion tensor, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, with deep learning models has yielded promising outcomes in discerning phenotypic characteristics and enhancing disease diagnosis. The development of such a technique hinges on the efficient fusion of heterogeneous multimodal features, which initially reside within distinct representation spaces. Naively fusing the multimodal features does not adequately capture the complementary information and could even produce redundancy. In this work, we present a novel joint self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning method to learn the robust latent feature representation from multimodal MRI data, allowing the projection of heterogeneous features into a shared common space, and thereby amalgamating both complementary and analogous information across various modalities and among similar subjects. We performed a comparative analysis between our proposed method and alternative deep multimodal learning approaches. Through extensive experiments on two independent datasets, the results demonstrated that our method is significantly superior to several other deep multimodal learning methods in predicting abnormal neurodevelopment. Our method has the capability to facilitate computer-aided diagnosis within clinical practice, harnessing the power of multimodal data.

  abstract={Background and Purpose: Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) can be prognostic for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCRT) in patients with esophageal cancer. However, manual tumor delineation is labor intensive and subjective. Furthermore, noise in DW-MRI images will propagate into the corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) signal. In this study a workflow is investigated that combines a denoising algorithm with semi-automatic segmentation for quantifying ADC changes. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with esophageal cancer who underwent nCRT before esophagectomy were included. One baseline and five weekly DW-MRI scans were acquired for every patient during nCRT. A self-supervised learning denoising algorithm, Patch2Self, was used to denoise the DWI-MRI images. A semi-automatic delineation workflow (SADW) was next developed and compared with a manually adjusted workflow (MAW). The agreement between workflows was determined using the Dice coefficients and Brand Altman plots. The prognostic value of ADCmean increases (%/week) for pathologic complete response (pCR) was assessed using c-statistics. Results: The median Dice coefficient between the SADW and MAW was 0.64 (interquartile range 0.20). For the MAW, the c-statistic for predicting pCR was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.56–1.00). The SADW showed a c-statistic of 0.84 (95%CI:0.63–1.00) after denoising. No statistically significant differences in c-statistics were observed between the workflows or after applying denoising. Conclusions: The SADW resulted in non-inferior prognostic value for pCR compared to the more laborious MAW, allowing broad scale applications. The effect of denoising on the prognostic value for pCR needs to be investigated in larger cohorts.},

  abstract={Background: Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), the predominant subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), ranks among the most common malignancies worldwide. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) plays a pivotal role in tumor progression, being closely linked with heightened chemoresistance and adverse prognosis in cancer patients. Nonetheless, the broader impact of vasculogenic mimicry-related genes (VRGs) on ccRCC patient prognosis, tumor microenvironment characteristics, and treatment response remains incompletely understood. Methods: Consensus clustering identified VRG-associated subtypes. We developed a machine learning framework integrating 12 algorithms to establish a consistent VM-related signature (VRG_score). The predictive value of VRG_score for ccRCC prognosis and treatment response was assessed. FOXM1′s clinical relevance was explored using the UCLCAN database. FOXM1 expression in tumor and adjacent tissues was assessed using Western Blotting, IHC, RNA-seq, and Chip-qPCR methods, and its regulatory mechanism was confirmed. Results: We examined VRG mutation and expression patterns in ccRCC at the gene level, identifying two distinct molecular clusters. A consensus VRG_score was formulated using a machine learning computational framework and Cox regression, displaying strong predictive power for prognosis and clinical translation. Additionally, FOXM1 was found to be upregulated in ccRCC, correlating with clinical pathological features and positively regulating PYCR1, thereby activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and promoting VM formation. Conclusion: This study constructed a VM-related signature and revealed that FOXM1 promotes VM formation in renal cell carcinoma through the PYCR1-PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis, serving as a prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic target.},

Radiomics is a method that extracts a large number of features from radiographic medical images using data-characterisation algorithms. These features, termed radiomic features, have the potential to uncover disease characteristics. The goal of both radiomics and texture analysis is to go beyond size or human-eye based semantic descriptors, to enable the non-invasive extraction of quantitative radiological data to correlate them with clinical outcomes or pathological characteristics. In the latest years there has been a flourishing sub-field of radiology where texture analysis and radiomics have been used in many settings. It is difficult for the clinical radiologist to cope with such amount of data in all the different radiological sub-fields and to identify the most significant papers. The aim of this review is to provide a tool to better understand the basic principles underlining texture analysis and radiological data mining and a summary of the most significant papers of the latest years.},

Methods: We obtained two gene expression profiling microarrays (GSE68571 and GSE74706) from the public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The purpose was to identify Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) between the lung adenocarcinoma group and the healthy control group. The limma R package in R was utilized for this analysis. For the differential gene diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and SVM-RFE screening crossover. To evaluate the performance, ROC curves were plotted. We performed immuno-infiltration analysis using CIBERSORT. Finally, we validated the key genes through qRT-PCR and Western-blot verification, then downregulated MMP17 gene expression, upregulated SH3GL2 gene expression, and performed CCK8 experiments. Results: A total of 32 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified. Two diagnostic marker genes, SH3GL2 and MMP17, were selected by employing LASSO and SVM-RFE machine learning methods. In Lung adenocarcinoma cells, the expression of MMP17 was observed to be elevated compared to normal lung epithelial cells in the control group (P < 0.05). In contrast, a down-regulation of SH3GL2 was found in Lung adenocarcinoma cells (P < 0.05). Finally, we downregulated MMP17 and upregulated SH3GL2 gene expression, then the CCK8 showed that the proliferation of both lung cancer cells was inhibited. Conclusion: SH3GL2 and MMP17 are expected to be potential biomarkers for Lung adenocarcinoma.},

However, the gene expression signatures associated with these CAF subtypes have yet to realize their potential as clinical biomarkers. Here, we describe an interpretable machine learning approach, additive multiple instance learning (aMIL), to predict bulk gene expression signatures from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images, focusing on an immunosuppressive LRRC15+ CAF-enriched TGFβ-CAF signature. aMIL models accurately predicted TGFβ-CAF across various cancer types. Tissue regions contributing most highly to slide-level predictions of TGFβ-CAF were evaluated by machine learning models characterizing spatial distributions of diverse cell and tissue types, stromal subtypes, and nuclear morphology. In breast cancer, regions contributing most to TGFβ-CAF-high predictions (“excitatory”) were localized to cancer stroma with high fibroblast density and mature collagen fibers. Regions contributing most to TGFβ-CAF-low predictions (“inhibitory”) were localized to cancer epithelium and densely inflamed stroma. Fibroblast and lymphocyte nuclear morphology also differed between excitatory and inhibitory regions. Thus, aMIL enables a data-driven link between histologic features and transcription, offering biological interpretability beyond typical black-box models.},

In recent years, with the rapid development of proteomics and bioinformatics, the use of machine learning technology to analyze protein characteristics provides a new idea for the early diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. The main purpose of this study is to deeply analyze the molecular mechanism and action mechanism of MSMB, TPPP3 and SPI1, which are closely related to pancreatic cancer, by constructing a feature model based on machine learning. The study collected a large number of proteomic data from pancreatic cancer patients and screened out candidate proteins associated with pancreatic cancer. Then the molecular characteristics of MSMB, TPPP3 and SPI1 were analyzed by bioinformatics tools. On this basis, machine learning algorithms were used to model the expression patterns and functions of these proteins. The accuracy and generalization ability of the model were verified by cross-validation and independent test sets, and finally a feature model that effectively distinguished pancreatic cancer from normal tissue was determined. Through the construction and verification of the machine learning model, we found that the expression patterns of MSMB, TPPP3 and SPI1 proteins in pancreatic cancer tissues were significantly different. The expression of MSMB protein is down-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissue, while the expression of TPPP3 and SPI1 protein is up-regulated. Further functional analysis indicated that MSMB may be involved in the development of pancreatic cancer through regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis, TPPP3 may be related to cytoskeleton stability and cell migration ability, and SPI1 may play an important role in immune escape of pancreatic cancer. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic cancer.},

Through gene expression standardization and Venn analysis, 80 overlapping genes were selected and enriched by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Key genes were identified based on LASSO analysis, while SHAP models were used to evaluate key DEGs and their interactions that influence glioma prediction models. Further analysis of UBTD2, including gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), cell culture experiments, transfection techniques and Westernblot, was performed to investigate its function in glioma cells. The results showed that UBTD2 was significantly upregulated in glioma cells and correlated with the expression of five key proteins. LASSO analysis identified key difference-expressed genes in gliomas, and SHAP analysis revealed the importance of these genes in predictive models. Further experiments showed that UBTD2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and invasion by up-regulating p53 expression, underscoring its potential function in gliomas.},

  abstract={Background: The intricate molecular landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presents a significant challenge to achieving precise risk stratification through clinical genetic testing. At present, there is a paucity of robust gene signatures that could assist clinicians in making clinical decisions for patients with HCC. Methods: We obtained gene expression profiles of patients with HCC from 20 independent cohorts available in public databases. A gene signature was developed by employing two machine learning algorithms. In addition to validating the signature with high-throughput data in public cohorts, we external validated the signature in 64 HCC cases by RT-PCR method. We compared genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic features between different subgroups. We also compared our signature to 130 gene signatures that have already been published. Results: We developed a novel four-gene signature, designated as HCC4, that demonstrates significant potential for the prediction of survival outcomes in more than 1300 patients with HCC. The HCC4 also has potential for predicting recurrence and tumor volume doubling time, assessing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and immunotherapy responses, and non-invasive detection of HCC. The high HCC4 score group shows a higher frequency of mutations in genes TP53, RB1 and TSC1/2, as well as increased activity of cell-cycle, glycolysis and hypoxia signaling pathways, higher cancer stemness score, and lower lipid metabolism activity. In seven HCC cohorts, HCC4 exhibited a higher average C-index in predicting overall survival compared to the 130 signatures previously published. Drug screening indicated that patients with high HCC4 scores were more sensitive to agents targeting AURKA, TUBB, JMJD6 and KIFC1. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that HCC4 is a powerful tool for improving risk stratification and for identifying HCC patients who are most likely to benefit from TACE treatment, immunotherapy, and other experimental therapies.},

Methods: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma transcriptome data and the corresponding clinical data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Single-cell sequencing data were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A risk model was established by integrating ten different machine learning algorithms, which resulted in 101 combined models. The model with the highest average C-index was selected for further analysis, and was assessed using nomogram, time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. The differences in immune infiltration fractions, clinicopathological features, and response to various targeted therapies and immunotherapy between high- and low-risk groups were investigated. Furthermore, qRT-PCR, IHC, colony formation test, CCK8 assay and flow cytometry were conducted to explore the expression pattern and function of ARHGAP9 in our own patient samples and renal cancer cell lines. Results: Totally, 156 NK cell-related genes and 5189 prognosis-related genes were identified, and 36 genes of their intersection demonstrated prognostic value. A risk model with 18 genes was established by Coxboost plus plsRcox, which can accurately predict the prognosis of ccRCC patients. Significant correlations were determined between risk score and tumor malignancy and immune cell infiltration. Meanwhile, a combination of tumor mutation burden plus risk score could have higher accuracy of predicting clinical outcomes. Moreover, high-risk group patients were more likely to be responsive to targeted therapy but show no response to immunotherapy. Conclusions: Intricate signaling interactions between NK cells and various cellular subgroups were depicted and the developmental trajectory of NK cells was elucidated. A NK cells-related risk model was established, which can provide reliable prognostic information and identified patients with more probability of benefiting from therapy.},

  abstract={This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and therapeutic mechanism of parthenolide (PTL) in breast cancer (BC) through a comprehensive strategy integrating network pharmacology, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and metabolomics. In network pharmacology, 70 therapeutic targets were identified, of which 16 core targets were filtered out through seven classical algorithms of Cytohubba plugin. Additionally, the hub module of PPI network was extracted using MCODE plugin. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation showed a potent binding affinity between PTL and JNK, subsequently validated by MST and SPR assays. Further, Mendelian randomization analysis indicated that JNK was causally associated with BC. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that PTL counteracted BC via promoting ROS generation, inducing apoptosis and suppressing proliferation, which potentially involved the coordinated regulation of MAPK and FoxO1 pathways. Moreover, ssGSEA and scRNA-seq analysis suggested that PTL may act on T cell immune microenvironment of BC. Subsequently, these bioinformatics-based predictions were experimentally validated using in-vitro and in-vivo models. Finally, metabolome profiling unveiled that PTL remodeled the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism as well as biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and thereby contributed to BC inhibition. From molecular, immune and metabolic perspectives, this study not only provided a unique insight into the mechanistic details of PTL against BC, but also proposed a novel promising therapeutic strategy for BC.},

  abstract={Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in women worldwide, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy has emerged as an option for the management of locally advanced breast cancer. Extensive efforts have been made to identify new molecular markers to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Transcripts that do not encode proteins, termed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), have been shown to display abnormal expression profiles in different types of cancer, but their role as biomarkers in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been extensively studied. Herein, lncRNA expression was profiled using RNA sequencing in biopsies from patients who subsequently showed either response or no response to treatment. GATA3-AS1 was overexpressed in the nonresponder group and was the most stable feature when performing selection in multiple random forest models. GATA3-AS1 was experimentally validated by quantitative RT-PCR in an extended group of 68 patients. Expression analysis confirmed that GATA3-AS1 is overexpressed primarily in patients who were nonresponsive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 75.0%. The statistical model was based on luminal B-like patients and adjusted by menopausal status and phenotype (odds ratio, 37.49; 95% CI, 6.74–208.42; P = 0.001); GATA3-AS1 was established as an independent predictor of response. Thus, lncRNA GATA3-AS1 is proposed as a potential predictive biomarker of nonresponse to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.},

  abstract={Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessing radiological response to primary systemic therapy (PST). Method: Prospective study between February 2021 and October 2022. Women with breast cancer and indication of PST were enrolled. CEM and MRI were performed before and after PST, and the findings, including size and radiological response pattern, were compared with the size of the residual lesion measured in surgical specimens and its Miller-Payne classification (considered the gold standard). Two of four independent radiologists, with 2 years of CEM experience and 10 years of MRI experience, reviewed the images while being blinded to the results of the other technique. The agreement between measurements was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and Lin's coefficient. Results: Forty-eight women with breast cancer who required PST were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 57.21 ± 10.14 years. A total of thirty-three participants (68.75 %) completed the study. The correlation between CEM and MRI measurements was high before PST (r: 0.97), and local staging was identical for 45 out of 48 patients. MRI demonstrated better accuracy in predicting residual tumor size than CEM, with Lin's coefficient 0.91 and 0.73, respectively. However, no significant differences were observed in predicting response to therapy. Both methods tended to overestimate the size and degree of response in our study, with mean overestimations of 2.87 mm in CEM and 0.51 mm in MRI. Conclusion: CEM was found to be as accurate as MRI in predicting response to PST, indicating its potential as an alternative imaging technique, but further research is necessary.},

  abstract={Background: Human epidermal growth receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous subgroup. Estrogen receptor (ER) status is emerging as a predictive marker within HER2+ BCs, with the HER2+/ER+ cases usually having better survival in the first 5 years after diagnosis but have higher recurrence risk after 5 years compared to HER2+/ER-. This is possibly because sustained ER signaling in HER2+ BCs helps escape the HER2 blockade. Currently HER2+/ER+ BC is understudied and lacks biomarkers. Thus, a better understanding of the underlying molecular diversity is important to find new therapy targets for HER2+/ER+ BCs. Methods: In this study, we performed unsupervised consensus clustering together with genome-wide Cox regression analyses on the gene expression data of 123 HER2+/ER+ BC from The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) cohort to identify distinct HER2+/ER+ subgroups. A supervised eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier was then built in TCGA using the identified subgroups and validated in another two independent datasets (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (accession number GSE149283)). Computational characterization analyses were also performed on the predicted subgroups in different HER2+/ER+ BC cohorts. Results: We identified two distinct HER2+/ER+ subgroups with different survival outcomes using the expression profiles of 549 survival-associated genes from the Cox regression analyses. Genome-wide gene expression differential analyses found 197 differentially expressed genes between the two identified subgroups, with 15 genes overlapping the 549 survival-associated genes. XGBoost classifier, using the expression values of the 15 genes, achieved a strong cross-validated performance (Area under the curve (AUC) = 0.85, Sensitivity = 0.76, specificity = 0.77) in predicting the subgroup labels. Further investigation partially confirmed the differences in survival, drug response, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, published gene signatures, and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screened gene dependency scores between the two identified subgroups. Conclusion: This is the first study to stratify HER2+/ER+ tumors. Overall, the initial results from different cohorts showed there exist two distinct subgroups in HER2+/ER+ tumors, which can be distinguished by a 15-gene signature. Our findings could potentially guide the development of future precision therapies targeted on HER2+/ER+ BC.},

  abstract={Background: Axillary lymph node status is important for breast cancer staging and treatment planning as the majority of breast cancer metastasis spreads through the axillary lymph nodes. There is currently no reliable noninvasive imaging method to detect nodal metastasis associated with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were those from the peak contrast dynamic image from 1.5 Tesla MRI scanners at the pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy stage. Data consisted of 66 abnormal nodes from 38 patients and 193 normal nodes from 61 patients. Abnormal nodes were those determined by expert radiologist based on 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images. Normal nodes were those with negative diagnosis of breast cancer. The convolutional neural network consisted of 5 convolutional layers with filters from 16 to 128. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate prediction performance. For comparison, an expert radiologist also scored the same nodes as normal or abnormal. Results: The convolutional neural network model yielded a specificity of 79.3% ± 5.1%, sensitivity of 92.1% ± 2.9%, positive predictive value of 76.9% ± 4.0%, negative predictive value of 93.3% ± 1.9%, accuracy of 84.8% ± 2.4%, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.91 ± 0.02 for the validation data set. These results compared favorably with scoring by radiologists (accuracy of 78%). Conclusion: The results are encouraging and suggest that this approach may prove useful for classifying lymph node status on MRI in clinical settings in patients with breast cancer, although additional studies are needed before routine clinical use can be realized. This approach has the potential to ultimately be a noninvasive alternative to lymph node biopsy.},

  abstract={The hallmarks of malignant illnesses include defective DNA repair capability and disruption of genomic integrity brought on by the accumulation of different types of DNA damage. In the case of breast cancer, previous research has suggested that specific SNPs within genes involved in DNA repair and tumor suppression pathways, such as OGG1 and TP53, may modulate an individual's susceptibility to the disease.TP53 and OGG1 play a significant role in genome integrity and DNA repair. The genetic variation in TP53 and OGG1 reduces the repair function and increases cancer risk. The present study aimed to evaluate the single nucleotide polymorphisms of these two genes to show the combined effect of TP53 and OGG1 genotypes in breast cancer. The present case-control study was carried out by collecting blood samples from 166 patients with breast cancer and 166 individuals without a personal history of breast cancer. Tetra-ARMS and AS-PCR were used to ascertain the genotypes. The online Javastat statistics package, MDR, and IBM SPSS Statistics 26 were used to analyze the data. In silico analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of OGG1 and TP53. A strong synergistic interaction between TP53 and OGG1, moderate synergistic interaction between OGG1 and age, and correlation between TP53 and age was indicated, suggesting a novel interaction between TP53 and OGG1. Moreover, the recessive model of the OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism (P = 0.039) had a protective effect against breast tumors. We found no significant relationship between TP53 Arg72Pro and susceptibility to breast cancer. In this study, the results suggested the OGG1- Ser326Cys GG genotype as a protective factor against the risk of breast cancer in a representative sample of Iranian-Azeri women. Also, using the MDR method, we discovered a gene-gene association between TP53 and OGG1.},

  abstract={Before the Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) treatment, it is of great clinical significance to avoid secondary genetic damage and guide the personalized treatment plans for patients with brain metastases (BM) by predicting the response to SRS treatment of brain metastatic lesions. Thus, we developed a multi-task learning model termed SRTRP-Net to provide prior knowledge of BM ROI and predict the SRS treatment response of the lesion. In dual-encoder tumor segmentation Network (DTS-Net), two parallel encoders encode the original and mirrored multi-modal MRI images. The differences in the dual-encoder features between foreground and background are enhanced by the symmetrical visual difference block (SVDB). In the bottom layer of the encoder, a transformer is used to extract local contextual features in the spatial and depth dimensions of low-resolution images. Then, the decoder of DTS-Net provides the prior knowledge for predicting the response to SRS treatment by performing BM segmentation. SRS response prediction network (SRP-Net) directly utilizes shared multi-modal MRI features weighted by the signed distance map (SDM) of the masks. The bidirectional multi-dimensional feature fusion module (BMDF) fuses the shared features and the clinical text information features to obtain comprehensive tumor information for characterizing tumors and predicting SRS treatment response. Experiments based on internal and external clinical datasets have shown that SRTRP-Net achieves comparable or better results. We believe that SRTRP-Net can help clinicians accurately develop personalized first-time treatment regimens for BM patients and improve their survival.},

  abstract={Background: Macrovascular invasion (MaVI) occurs in nearly half of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients at diagnosis or during follow-up, which causes severe disease deterioration, and limits the possibility of surgical approaches. This study aimed to investigate whether computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics analysis could help predict development of MaVI in HCC. Methods: A cohort of 226 patients diagnosed with HCC was enrolled from 5 hospitals with complete MaVI and prognosis follow-ups. CT-based radiomics signature was built via multi-strategy machine learning methods. Afterwards, MaVI-related clinical factors and radiomics signature were integrated to construct the final prediction model (CRIM, clinical-radiomics integrated model) via random forest modeling. Cox-regression analysis was used to select independent risk factors to predict the time of MaVI development. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to stratify patients according to the time of MaVI development, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) based on the selected risk factors. Results: The radiomics signature showed significant improvement for MaVI prediction compared with conventional clinical/radiological predictors (P < 0.001). CRIM could predict MaVI with satisfactory areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.986 and 0.979 in the training (n = 154) and external validation (n = 72) datasets, respectively. CRIM presented with excellent generalization with AUC of 0.956, 1.000, and 1.000 in each external cohort that accepted disparate CT scanning protocol/manufactory. Peel9_fos_InterquartileRange [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.98; P < 0.001] was selected as the independent risk factor. The cox-regression model successfully stratified patients into the high-risk and low-risk groups regarding the time of MaVI development (P < 0.001), PFS (P < 0.001) and OS (P = 0.002). Conclusions: The CT-based quantitative radiomics analysis could enable high accuracy prediction of subsequent MaVI development in HCC with prognostic implications.},

  abstract={Background: Breast cancer (BC), the most common cancer among women globally, has been shown by numerous studies to significantly involve non-apoptotic regulatory cell death (RCD) in its pathogenesis and progression. Methods: We obtained the RNA sequences and clinical data of BC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for the training set, while datasets GSE96058, GSE86166, and GSE20685 from The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were utilized as validation cohorts. Initially, we performed non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering analysis on the BC samples from the TCGA database to discern non-apoptotic RCD-related molecular subtypes. To identify prognostically-relevant non-apoptotic RCD genes (NRGs) and construct a prognostic model, we implemented three machine learning algorithms: lasso regression, random forest, and XGBoost analysis. The expression of selected genes was verified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, and The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. The risk signature was evaluated concerning clinical characteristics and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, we developed a nomogram to predict BC patient survival. Results: The NMF method successfully compartmentalized patients from the TCGA database into three distinct non-apoptotic RCD-related subtypes, with significant variations observed in immune characteristics and prognostic stratification across these subtypes. We identified 5 differentially expressed NRGs used in establishing the risk signature. Patients with different risk groups exhibited distinct clinicopathological features, drug sensitivity, and prognostic outcomes. A nomogram was subsequently developed, incorporating the NRGs-related risk signature, age, T stage, and N stage, to aid clinical decision-making. Conclusion: We identified a novel NRGs-related risk signature, which was expected to become a potential prognostic marker in BC.},

  abstract={Objectives: To investigate the relationship of pre-treatment MR image features (including breast density) and clinical-pathologic characteristics with overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: This retrospective study obtained an approval of the institutional review board and the written informed consents of patients were waived. From October 2013 to April 2019, 130 patients (mean age, 47.6 ± 9.4 years) were included. The univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to analyze factors associated with OS, including MR image parameters and clinical-pathologic characteristics. Results: Among the 130 included patients, 11 (8.5%) patients (mean age, 48.4 ± 11.8 years) died of breast cancer recurrence or distant metastasis. The median follow-up length was 70 months (interquartile range of 60–85 months). According to the Cox regression analysis, older age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.769, 95% confidence interval [CI]): 1.330, 2.535), higher T stage (HR = 2.490, 95%CI:2.047, 3.029), higher N stage (HR = 1.869, 95%CI:1.507, 2.317), low breast density (HR = 1.693, 95%CI:1.391, 2.060), peritumoral edema (HR = 1.408, 95%CI:1.078, 1.840), axillary lymph nodes invasion (HR = 3.118, 95%CI:2.505, 3.881) on MR were associated with worse OS (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Pre-treatment MR features and clinical-pathologic parameters are valuable for predicting long-time OS of breast cancer patients after NAC followed by surgery. Low breast density, peritumoral edema and axillary lymph nodes invasion on pre-treatment MR images were associated with worse prognosis.},

We introduce a data-driven yet interpretable approach for identifying cellular patterns in the TME associated with patient prognoses. Our method relies on constructing a bi-level graph model: a cellular graph, which models the TME, and a population graph, capturing inter-patient similarities given their respective cellular graphs. We demonstrate our approach in breast cancer, showing that the identified patterns provide a risk-stratification system with new complementary information to standard clinical subtypes, and these results are validated in two independent cohorts. Our methodology could be applied to other cancer types more generally, providing insights into the spatial cellular patterns associated with patient outcomes.},

  abstract={Interaction of immune system and cancer cells plays a crucial role in defining the physical and chemical characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, monitoring and analyzing these interactions may prove essential for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. While standard techniques assessing cellular interaction are technically complicated and usually expensive, engineering solutions can be employed to introduce novel methods and effective techniques. In this paper, we presented a new blood-based breast cancer hallmark for people suspected of breast tumor disease (BTD) by time-lapse microscopy imaging from the interaction between the patient's blood and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. The detection protocol is based on the quantifying invasion of the WBCs to the breast cancer cell line. Many cytological, molecular, and immunofluorescent assays were carried out to approve the hypothesis. Blood immune cells showed meaningful invasion patterns to breast cancer cell lines in reverse correlation by the cancerous stage of the patients. Hence, we believe that the immune system is cognizant of the neoplastic nature of breast tumor disease. To eliminate all the human-related limitations, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used for invasion recognition. The proposed CNN architecture showed an accuracy of approximately 86%, making it a reliable, fast, and easy way for intelligent detection of invasion patterns to decide on the tumor stage. Results made us present the hypothesis that people with more aggressive breast cancer tumors have less strong immune cells to invade cancer cells which could be a start in the clinical use of the cellular-based immune system for cancer investigation. As WBCs were isolated from the blood with no pre-processing, this method would shed new light as a simple complementary method for better clarification of tumor nature.},

  abstract={Background: Breast cancer (BRCA) is the most common malignancy in women worldwide. Selenium (Se), a crucial trace element, significantly impacts BRCA patient survival, although its roles in tumorigenesis, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and precision therapy remain unclear. Methods: We used Mendelian randomization to investigate the causal link between blood Se and BRCA risk. Transcriptome profiling of 25 selenoproteins, combined with the TCGA-BRCA and METABRIC cohorts, identified Se-related patterns, including two Se clusters, and a Se-related risk score (SeRS) was developed via machine learning. We assessed the relationships of the SeRS with clinical features, prognosis, cancer hallmarks, stemness, the TIME, and the ICI therapy response. The CMap database identified potential BRCA drugs, while random forests pinpointed critical selenoproteins. In vitro experiments in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells explored the impact of MSRB1 on tumor characteristics and oxidative stress. Results: Our results established a protective causal link between blood Se and BRCA risk. Two Se clusters (SeC1 and SeC2) were identified on the basis of selenoprotein expression. The SeRS, which incorporates SELENOH, GPX4, GPX1, MSRB1, TXRND1, and SELENOV, strongly predicted clinical outcomes and ICI therapy response. Potential drugs to overcome chemotherapy resistance were identified. MSRB1, with the highest copy number variation (CNV) and a significant role in BRCA, was deemed the most critical selenoprotein in BRCA. Its depletion significantly reduced BRCA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while increasing reactive oxygen species. Conclusions: This study introduces a novel selenoprotein-based classification and prognostic signature for BRCA patients, enhancing personalized prognosis and precision therapy. These findings highlight MSRB1 as a potential therapeutic target, offering new insights into the roles of Se and selenoproteins in BRCA treatment.},

  abstract={We develop a family of mathematical models to predict patient-specific response to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. The models capture key features of tumor growth, therapeutic response, and tissue mechanics that are informed by diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. We then calibrate the models to synthetic and clinical data using Bayesian inference to give a description of the parameter uncertainties. Given the family of models and the calibration scheme, we perform three analyses. First, we test the identifiability of each model; that is, given synthetic data with the same level of noise as that seen in the clinical setting, are we able to accurately recover parameter values employed to generate the data? Second, we test the identifiability of the framework itself; that is, when data is generated by one model from the family, is that model selected as the best one during the calibration? Third, we apply our model family to predict patient-specific response on a cohort of 32 patients with triple negative breast cancer. For analysis 1, we show that we can recover the parameters used to generate synthetic data (with 5%, 10%, and 15% Gaussian noise — greater than that typically seen in magnetic resonance imaging in the clinical setting) with a mean error of 5.9% (+/−1.4%). For analysis 2, the model used to generate the data is selected as the best model for over 50% of the synthetic data sets, provided that the noise level in the synthetic data is less than 10%. For analysis 3, we show that the calibrated drug efficacy rate in the diffusion and proliferation mechanically coupled, drug informed, reaction–diffusion model strongly correlates with patient response to therapy with an area under the curve score of 0.85 in a receiver operator characteristic analysis. Thus, our framework shows that, within the noise levels encountered in the clinical setting, a high level of rigor can be achieved for mathematical model parameterizations and selections, and this translates into high accuracy for predicting responders and non-responders to neoadjuvant therapy.},

  abstract={Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment, but durable clinical responses remain limited, underscoring the need for robust predictive biomarkers. We integrated multiomics profiling with machine learning to systematically identify determinants of ICB efficacy. Comparative evaluation of 22 survival algorithms across four NSCLC cohorts (n=156) led to the development of an Accelerated Oblique Random Survival Forest model, which outperformed conventional Cox regression and deep learning methods in predictive accuracy (training C-index=0.864; test C-index=0.748). Single-cell RNA sequencing of an immunotherapy-treated cohort revealed that high-risk tumors harbor malignant epithelial subclusters expressing growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a transforming growth factor-β superfamily member implicated in immune evasion. Single-cell non-negative matrix factorization identified GDF15 as a network hub regulating proliferative dominance. External validation using melanoma cohorts (GSE91061) confirmed the pan-cancer predictive relevance of GDF15 and its associated tumor cluster. Functional studies utilizing GDF15-knockdown Lewis lung carcinoma cells showed no significant effect on intrinsic tumor proliferation or growth under immune stress (both p>0.05). GDF15 deletion significantly potentiated PD-1 inhibitor efficacy in vivo, reducing tumor mass by 94.41±6.53 % (SH1) and 94.54±5.21 % (SH2) compared with 3.39±54.90 % in empty vector controls (p<0.01 for all comparisons). CD8+ T cell infiltration was also substantially enhanced (81.62±4.79 % [SH1] and 123.50±10.02 % [SH2] vs. 29.63±22.17 % [EV], p<0.05). These findings implicate GDF15 as a regulator of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Our findings position GDF15 as a first-in-class biomarker for predicting ICB resistance; they establish a translational framework that bridges computational prediction with single-cell mechanistic insights to inform NSCLC immunotherapy.},

  abstract={Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignancy among women, with incidence rates rising annually. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been recognized as a key regulator in the onset and progression of BC. Nevertheless, the role of m6A-associated metabolic genes (mMGs) in BC regulation remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we first analyzed and clustered single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) data from the peripheral blood of BC patients. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across various cell populations were intersected with mMGs to identify differentially expressed mMGs (DEmMGs). The AUCell algorithm was employed to score DEmMGs across cell populations, followed by subgroup clustering of high-scoring cell types. Additionally, DEGs from BC and control transcriptomic (RNA-seq) data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were intersected with DEmMGs. BC subtypes were identified based on the expression levels of overlapping genes, and differences in survival rates and immune microenvironment characteristics were examined across subtypes. A BC risk model was constructed using Lasso-Cox regression, and variations in prognosis, tumor mutational burden, immune cell infiltration, and drug sensitivity were explored. Finally, real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot (WB) were used to validate the identified prognostic genes. NDUFAB1, VDAC1, TYMP, UGDH, ATP6AP1, and ALDH2 showed consistent and significant expression differences between the BC and control groups. This study's identification of key prognostic genes and the development of a risk model offer potential new targets for therapeutic intervention and clinical management of BC.},

Immunohistochemical staining is commonly used clinically to identify the molecular subtype for subsequent treatment and prognosis. Purpose: Raman spectroscopy and support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm were utilized to identify blood samples from breast cancer patients in order to investigate a novel molecular typing approach. Method: Tumor tissue coarse needle aspiration biopsy samples, and peripheral venous blood samples were gathered from 459 invasive breast cancer patients admitted to the breast department of Sichuan Cancer Hospital between June 2021 and September 2022. Immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization were performed on the coarse needle aspiration biopsy tissues to obtain their molecular typing pathological labels, including: 70 cases of Luminal A, 167 cases of Luminal B (HER2-positive), 57 cases of Luminal B (HER2-negative), 84 cases of HER2-positive, and 81 cases of triple-negative. Blood samples were processed to obtained Raman spectra taken for SVM classification models establishment with machine algorithms (using 80% of the sample data as the training set), and then the performance of the SVM classification models was evaluated by the independent validation set (20% of the sample data). Results: The AUC values of SVM classification models remained above 0.85, demonstrating outstanding model performance and excellent subtype discrimination of breast cancer molecular subtypes. Conclusion: Raman spectroscopy of serum samples can promptly and precisely detect the molecular subtype of invasive breast cancer, which has the potential for clinical value.},

New advances in systemic and targeted therapies have increased rates of pathologic complete response increasing the number of patients undergoing NAT. Clear benefits of NAT are downstaging the tumor and the axillary nodes to de-escalate surgery and to evaluate response to treatment. Selection of patients for NAT in EBC rely in several factors that are related to patient characteristics (i.e, age and comorbidities), to tumor histology, to stage at diagnosis and to the potential changes in surgical or adjuvant treatments when NAT is administered. Imaging and histologic confirmation is performed to assess extent of disease y to confirm diagnosis. Besides mammogram and ultrasound, functional breast imaging MRI has been incorporated to better predict treatment response and residual disease. Contrast enhanced mammogram (CEM), shear wave elastography (SWE), or Dynamic Optical Breast Imaging (DOBI) are emerging techniques under investigation for assessment of response to neoadjuvant therapy as well as for predicting response. Surgical plan should be delineated after NAT taking into account baseline characteristics, tumor response and patient desire. In the COVID era, we have witnessed also the increasing use of NAT in patients who may be directed to surgery, unable to have it performed as surgery has been reserved for emergency cases only.},

The current study introduces an optimization algorithm, Learner Performance-Based Behavior with Simulated Annealing (LPBSA), integrated with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as a neural network technique to improve disease prediction accuracy. The algorithm was tested on six preclinical datasets (one is related to diabetes, two are related to heart disease, and three are related to COVID-19). In addition to LPBSA-MLP, other optimization algorithms, including Fitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO), the original Learner Performance-Based Behavior (LPB), were independently combined with MLP. Furthermore, all three algorithms were integrated with a Cascading Multilayer Perceptron (LPBSA-CMLP, FDO-CMLP, LPB-CMLP) to enhance the convergence speed and learning capability. This allowed for a comprehensive comparison across diverse algorithmic configurations and enabled the identification of the most efficient model for disease prediction. The proposed LPBSA-MLP model achieved 100% accuracy on four data sets and at least 99.31% on the others. Further metrics confirm its performance: sensitivity and specificity values reached 100%, and Mean Square Error (MSE) values ranged from 0.0008 to 0.003. When benchmarked against models trained with FDO-MLP, LPB-MLP, and other standard optimizers, LPBSA-MLP consistently outperformed them in terms of both classification performance and convergence speed. These findings indicate the effectiveness of LPBSA in enhancing predictive modeling for critical health conditions.},

  abstract={Background: Breast cancer (BRCA) ranks among the most frequently diagnosed malignancies worldwide. Immune infiltration plays a critical role in tumor progression and therapeutic response. However, the precise mechanisms underlying immune infiltration in BRCA remain incompletely understood. Methods: Machine learning (support vector machine-recursive feature elimination and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression) and weighted gene co-expression network were utilized to screen hub genes. An immune infiltration assessment was carried out via TIMER and CIBERSORT. The prognostic and survival of risk model and immune infiltration-associated hub genes were analyzed through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression, and ROC curve evaluation. Cell functional assays and xenograft models in vivo were utilized to examine lipoprotein lipase (LPL) function. The impact of LPL on macrophage polarization was evaluated using THP-1-derived macrophages and immunohistochemistry analysis of immune infiltration (CD4, CD8, and F4/80) in vivo. Results: 10 hub immune regulators were identified in BRCA, which were associated with lipid metabolism. Hub genes and a prognostic risk model exhibited high predictive accuracy for BRCA patient survival and prognosis. Overexpression of LPL inhibited BRCA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting M1-like macrophage polarization. In vivo, LPL overexpression significantly suppressed tumor growth and enhanced immune cell infiltration, as indicated by the elevation of CD4 + and F4/80 + cells along with a decline in CD8 + macrophage abundance. Conclusion: This study identifies a novel lipid metabolism-related gene signature and demonstrates that LPL overexpression modulates macrophage polarization and inhibits BRCA progression.},

Here we discuss the multifaceted role of deep learning in cancer care, ranging from risk stratification, the screening and diagnosis of cancer, to the prediction of genomic mutations, treatment response and survival outcome prediction, through the use of convolutional neural networks. Another role of artificial intelligence is in the generation of automated radiology reports, which is a boon in high-volume centres to minimise report turnaround time. Although a validated and deployable deep-learning model for clinical use is still in its infancy, there is ongoing research to overcome the barriers for its universal implementation and we also delve into this aspect. We also briefly describe the role of radiomics in oncoimaging. Artificial intelligence can provide answers pertaining to cancer management at baseline imaging, saving cost and time. Imaging biobanks, which are repositories of anonymised images, are also briefly described. We also discuss the commercialisation and ethical issues pertaining to artificial intelligence. The latest generation generalist artificial intelligence model is also briefly described at the end of the article. We believe this article will not only enrich knowledge, but also promote research acumen in the minds of readers to take oncoimaging to another level using artificial intelligence and also work towards clinical translation of such research.},

  abstract={Nowadays, breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women globally. Approximately 10% to 15% of breast cancer patients fail to undergo timely screening, resulting in a missed opportunity for optimal treatment. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been used successfully in breast cancer diagnosis. Nevertheless, current systems have encountered difficulties in achieving a high degree of accuracy, with the majority of research efforts focusing on the binary classification that distinguishes benign from malignant. Different subtypes of breast cancer require different targeted therapeutic approaches. Therefore, the precise classification of the breast cancer subtype has a major impact on treatment decisions. To improve the accuracy of breast cancer multi-classification, a novel Attention-based Mask Reconstruction Module (AMRM) is proposed to improve the performance of the model. AMRM extracts features from breast cancer histopathological images through the attention module and then performs mask reconstruction to generate reconstructed features. These reconstructed features were used in a multi-classification task to accurately classify histopathological images of breast cancer. AMRM enables the network to effectively identify background and foreground in histopathological images, reduce background interference, improve adaptability to background changes, align the features extracted by the model with the pathologist's expectations, and improve classification accuracy. Results from experiments conducted on the BreakHis dataset show that the inclusion of AMRM resulted in a significant improvement in multi-classification accuracy for the AlexNet, VGG11, ResNet-50 and Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) models, reaching 88.48%, 93.40%, 96.49% and 94.10% respectively. Compared to the baseline model, accuracy increased by 8.28%, 2.11%, 1.27% and 1.26% respectively, demonstrating a significant improvement.},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: To develop an easy-to-use model by combining pretreatment MRI and clinicopathologic features for early prediction of tumor regression pattern to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 420 patients who received NAC and underwent definitive surgery in our hospital from February 2012 to August 2020. Pathologic findings of surgical specimens were used as the gold standard to classify tumor regression patterns into concentric and non-concentric shrinkage. Morphologic and kinetic MRI features were both analyzed. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to select the key clinicopathologic and MRI features for pretreatment prediction of regression pattern. Logistic regression and six machine learning methods were used to construct prediction models, and their performance were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: Two clinicopathologic variables and three MRI features were selected as independent predictors to construct prediction models. The apparent area under the curve (AUC) of seven prediction models were in the range of 0.669-0.740. The logistic regression model yielded an AUC of 0.708 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.658-0.759), and the decision tree model achieved the highest AUC of 0.740 (95% CI: 0.691-0.787). For internal validation, the optimism-corrected AUCs of seven models were in the range of 0.592-0.684. There was no significant difference between the AUCs of the logistic regression model and that of each machine learning model. Conclusion: Prediction models combining pretreatment MRI and clinicopathologic features are useful for predicting tumor regression pattern in breast cancer, which can assist to select patients who can benefit from NAC for de-escalation of breast surgery and modify treatment strategy.},

  abstract={Objectives: Breast cancers show different regression patterns after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Certain regression patterns are associated with more reliable margins in breast-conserving surgery. Our study aims to establish a nomogram based on radiomic features and clinicopathological factors to predict regression patterns in breast cancer patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 144 breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent definitive surgery in our center from January 2016 to December 2019. Tumor regression patterns were categorized as type 1 (concentric regression + pCR) and type 2 (multifocal residues + SD + PD) based on pathological results. We extracted 1158 multidimensional features from 2 sequences of MRI images. After feature selection, machine learning was applied to construct a radiomic signature. Clinical characteristics were selected by backward stepwise selection. The combined prediction model was built based on both the radiomic signature and clinical factors. The predictive performance of the combined prediction model was evaluated. Results: Two radiomic features were selected for constructing the radiomic signature. Combined with two significant clinical characteristics, the combined prediction model showed excellent prediction performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.902 (95% confidence interval 0.8343–0.9701) in the primary cohort and 0.826 (95% confidence interval 0.6774–0.9753) in the validation cohort. Conclusions: Our study established a unique model combining a radiomic signature and clinicopathological factors to predict tumor regression patterns prior to the initiation of NAC. The early prediction of type 2 regression offers the opportunity to modify preoperative treatments or aids in determining surgical options.},

In the hormone receptor (HR)-negative subgroup, a higher proportion and more infiltration of immune cells (i.e., tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TILs]), particularly cytotoxic T cells, are associated with better treatment responses. In the HR-positive subgroup, the closeness and aggregation of HER2-strong-positive tumor cells, as opposed to a uniform distribution, are linked to a lower response rate and HER2 luminal-like (HER2-LUM) subtype, which more closely resembles HR+/HER2− breast cancer. In addition, we develop a clinically practical predictive model capable of predicting neoadjuvant treatment responses to SHR-A1811 and other novel ADCs based on clinicopathological characteristics and pathological images.},

  abstract={Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options, which warrants the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Deciphering nuances in the tumor microenvironment (TME) may unveil insightful links between antitumor immunity and clinical outcomes; however, such connections remain underexplored. Here, we employed a data set derived from imaging mass cytometry of 71 TNBC patient specimens at single-cell resolution and performed in-depth quantifications with a suite of multiscale computational algorithms. The TNBC TME reflected a heterogeneous ecosystem with high spatial and compositional heterogeneity. Spatial analysis identified 10 recurrent cellular neighborhoods—a collection of local TME characteristics with unique cell components. The prevalence of cellular neighborhoods enriched with B cells, fibroblasts, and tumor cells, in conjunction with vascular density and perivasculature immune profiles, could significantly enrich long-term survivors. Furthermore, relative spatial colocalization of SMAhi fibroblasts and tumor cells compared with B cells correlated significantly with favorable clinical outcomes. Using a deep learning model trained on engineered spatial data, we can predict with high accuracy (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 5-fold cross-validation = 0.71) how a separate cohort of patients in the NeoTRIP clinical trial will respond to treatment based on baseline TME features. These data reinforce that the TME architecture is structured in cellular compositions, spatial organizations, vasculature biology, and molecular profiles and suggest novel imaging-based biomarkers for the treatment development in the context of TNBC.},

  abstract={Breast cancer is the second leading cause of female mortality globally. Effective diagnostic tools, such as biosensors that utilize reliable biomarkers, are essential for early detection, particularly in low-income countries. This study introduces a novel bioinformatics pipeline that uses machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to identify genetic biomarkers for classifying breast cancer into non-malignant, non-triple-negative, and triple-negative categories. Five Gene Selection Approaches (GSAs) were employed: LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), Membrane LASSO, Surfaceome LASSO, Network Analysis, and Feature Importance Score (FIS). We implemented three factorial designs to assess the impact of MLAs and GSAs on classification performance (F1 Macro and Accuracy) in both cell lines and patient samples. Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in the first four GSAs, we reduced the gene count to eight per GSA while maintaining an F1 Macro ≥80 %. Consequently, 95.5 % of our treatments with these gene sets achieved an F1 Macro or Accuracy ranging from 70.3 % to 97.2 %. We analyzed 37 genes for their predictive power in terms of five-year survival and relapse-free survival and compared them with genes from four commercial panels. Notably, thirteen genes (MFSD2A, TMEM74, SFRP1, UBXN10, CACNA1H, ERBB2, SIDT1, TMEM129, MME, FLRT2, CA12, ESR1, and TBC1D9) showed significant predictive capabilities for up to five years of survival. TBC1D9, UBXN10, SFRP1, and MME were significant for relapse-free survival after five years. The FOXC1, MLPH, FOXA1, ESR1, ERBB2, and SFRP1 genes also matched those described in commercial panels. The influence of MLA on F1 Macro and Accuracy was not statistically significant. Altogether, the genetic biomarkers identified in this study hold potential for use in biosensors aimed at breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract={Major pathologic remission (MPR, residual tumor <10%) is a promising clinical endpoint for prognosis analysis in patients with lung cancer receiving pre-operative PD-1 blockade therapy. Most of the current biomarkers for predicting MPR such as PD-L1 and tumor mutation burden (TMB) need to be obtained invasively. They cannot overcome the spatiotemporal heterogeneity or provide dynamic monitoring solutions. Radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) models provide a practical tool enabling non-invasive follow-up observation of tumor structural information through high-throughput data analysis. Currently, AI-based models mainly focus on the single baseline scan or pipeline, namely sole radiomics or deep learning (DL). This work merged the delta-radiomics based on the slope of classic radiomics indexes within a time interval and the features extracted by deep networks from the subtraction between the baseline and follow-up images. The subtracted images describing the tumor changes were based on the transformation generated by registration. Stepwise optimization of components was performed by repeating experiments among various combinations of DL networks, registration methods, feature selection algorithms, and classifiers. The optimized model could predict MPR with a cross-validation AUC of 0.91 and an external validation AUC of 0.85. A core set of 27 features (eight classic radiomics, 15 delta-radiomics, one classic DL features, and three delta-DL features) was identified. The changes in delta-radiomics indexes during the treatment were fitted with mathematic models. The fitting results revealed that over half of the features were of non-linear dynamics. Therefore, non-linear modifications were made on eight features by replacing the original features with non-linear fitting parameters, and the modified model achieved an improved power. The dynamic hybrid model serves as a novel and promising tool to predict the response of lesions to PD-1 blockade, which implies the importance of introducing the non-linear dynamic effects and DL approaches to the original delta-radiomics in the future.},

  abstract={Objectives: The aim of this study was to establish and validate the interpretable combined models for treatment response (TR) and hematologic toxicity (HT) after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC). Methods: 195 patients with LAGC were enrolled from two centres (117, 50 and 28 patients in the training, internal validation and external validation cohorts). The changes of radiomics features from pre-treatment and post-treatment gastric computed tomography images were extracted to build delta radiomics score and predict TR, as well as another radiomics score from pre-treatment vertebral computed tomography images for the prediction of HT, and both combined models were established from clinicopathological characteristics and radiomics score. The predictive performance of the combined models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristics, calibration and decision curve analyses. Interpretability was assessed using the shapley additive explanations framework (SHAP). Results: The area under curve (AUC) in the combined model for predicting TR were 0.893,0.846 and 0.913 for the training, internal validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. The AUC in the combined model for predicting HT were 0.871, 0.917 and 0.865 for the training, internal validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. SHAP summary plots show the importance of each feature on the prediction outcome, while waterfall and force plots depict individual features’ contributions to a response variable. Conclusions: The combined models based on radiomics features for predicting TR and HT after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in LAGC demonstrated good predictive performance.},

  abstract={Purpose: To investigate whether longitudinal changes in multiparametric MRI can predict early response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) and to further establish quantitative models based on these features. Methods: A total of 164 HER2-positive BC patients from three centers were included. MRI was performed at baseline and after two cycles of NAC (early post-NAC). Clinicopathological characteristics were enrolled. MRI features were evaluated at baseline and early post-NAC, as well as longitudinal changes in multiparametric MRI, including changes in the largest diameter (LD) of the tumor (ΔLD), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values (ΔADC), and time–signal intensity curve (TIC) (ΔTIC). The patients were divided into a training set (n = 95), an internal validation set (n = 31), and an independent external validation set (n = 38). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the independent indicators of pCR, which were then used to establish the clinicopathologic model and combined model. The AUC was used to evaluate the predictive power of the different models and calibration curves were used to evaluate the consistency of the prediction of pCR in different models. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to determine the clinical usefulness of the different models. Results: Two models were enrolled in this study, including the clinicopathologic model and the combined model. The LD at early post-NAC (OR=0.913, 95 % CI=0.953–0.994 p = 0.026), ΔADC (OR=1.005, 95 % CI=1.005–1.008, p = 0.007), and ΔTIC (OR=3.974, 95 % CI=1.276–12.358, p = 0.017) were identified as the best predictors of NAC response. The combined model constructed by the combination of LD at early post-NAC, ΔADC, and ΔTIC showed good predictive performance in the training set (AUC=0.87), internal validation set (AUC=0.78), and external validation set (AUC=0.79), which performed better than the clinicopathologic model in all sets. Conclusions: The changes in multiparametric MRI can predict early treatment response for HER2-positive BC and may be helpful for individualized treatment planning.},

  abstract={Purpose: To apply our convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response using the I-SPY TRIAL breast MRI dataset. Methods: From the I-SPY TRIAL breast MRI database, 131 patients from 9 institutions were successfully downloaded for analysis. First post-contrast MRI images were used for 3D segmentation using 3D slicer. Our CNN was implemented entirely of 3 × 3 convolutional kernels and linear layers. The convolutional kernels consisted of 6 residual layers, totaling 12 convolutional layers. Dropout with a 0.5 keep probability and L2 normalization was utilized. Training was implemented by using the Adam optimizer. A 5-fold cross validation was used for performance evaluation. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on a Linux workstation with one NVidia Titan X GPU. Results: Of 131 patients, 40 patients achieved pCR following NAC (group 1) and 91 patients did not achieve pCR following NAC (group 2). Diagnostic accuracy of our CNN two classification model distinguishing patients with pCR vs non-pCR was 72.5 (SD ± 8.4), with sensitivity 65.5% (SD ± 28.1) and specificity of 78.9% (SD ± 15.2). The area under a ROC Curve (AUC) was 0.72 (SD ± 0.08). Conclusion: It is feasible to use our CNN algorithm to predict NAC response in patients using a multi-institution dataset.},

  abstract={Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains a significant cause of mortality among gynecologic cancers, with the majority of cases being diagnosed at an advanced stage. Before targeted therapies were available, EOC treatment relied largely on debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Vascular endothelial growth factors have been identified as inducing tumor angiogenesis. According to several clinical trials, anti–vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy with bevacizumab was effective in all phases of EOC treatment. However, there are currently no biomarkers accessible for regular therapeutic use despite the importance of patient selection. Microsatellite instability (MSI), caused by a deficiency of the DNA mismatch repair system, is a molecular abnormality observed in EOC associated with Lynch syndrome. Recent evidence suggests that angiogenesis and MSI are interconnected. Developing predictive biomarkers, which enable the selection of patients who might benefit from bevacizumab-targeted therapy or immunotherapy, is critical for realizing personalized precision medicine. In this study, we developed 2 improved deep learning methods that eliminate the need for laborious detailed image-wise annotations by pathologists and compared them with 3 state-of-the-art methods to not only predict the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with EOC using mismatch repair protein immunostained tissue microarrays but also predict MSI status directly from histopathologic images. In prediction of therapeutic outcomes, the 2 proposed methods achieved excellent performance by obtaining the highest mean sensitivity and specificity score using MSH2 or MSH6 markers and outperformed 3 state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Moreover, both statistical analysis results, using Cox proportional hazards model analysis and Kaplan-Meier progression-free survival analysis, confirm that the 2 proposed methods successfully differentiate patients with positive therapeutic effects and lower cancer recurrence rates from patients experiencing disease progression after treatment (P <.01). In prediction of MSI status directly from histopathology images, our proposed method also achieved a decent performance in terms of mean sensitivity and specificity score even for imbalanced data sets for both internal validation using tissue microarrays from the local hospital and external validation using whole section slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas archive.},

  abstract={Aims: To explore the independent and additional value of oedema and shrinkage patterns for predicting the disease-free survival (DFS) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response in luminal breast cancer (BC). Materials and Methods: Patients with luminal BC who underwent NAC were enrolled in this study from 2017 to 2022. Traditional MRI features include BI-RADS-based MRI descriptors, tumor size, and ADC values, while emerging MRI features include oedema and shrinkage patterns, all of which were evaluated before, early, and after NAC. The changes in features during NAC were also evaluated. The value of features was evaluated through univariate, multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 258 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 77 responded to NAC. Diffuse oedema, stable or increased oedema during early NAC were adverse predictors for treatment response, while a greater reduction in tumor size and increase in ADC value were favorable predictors (all P<0.05). Furthermore, 20 of 60 patients who were followed up experienced recurrence. Diffuse oedema, pre-pectoral or subcutaneous oedema, and non-concentric shrinkage patterns after NAC were risk factors for DFS, whereas a greater increase in ADC value was a protective factor. Incorporating oedema and shrinkage patterns into traditional MRI features improved the predictive performance for treatment response (AUC from 0.76–0.78 to 0.80–0.83) and DFS (C-index from 0.67–69 to 0.75–0.80). Conclusions: Oedema is an unfavorable predictor for treatment response and survival outcomes, while shrinkage patterns contribute more to the prognostic value, both of which could offer supplementary benefits for clinical outcomes in luminal BC.},

This study demonstrates the potential of integrating multimodal baseline data, including computed tomography scan images and digital H&E-stained pathology images, with biological interpretation to predict the response to immunotherapy-based combination therapy using a multicenter cohort of 298 GC patients. By employing seven machine learning approaches, we developed a radiopathomics signature (RPS) to predict treatment response and stratify prognostic risk in GC. The RPS demonstrated area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.978 (95 % CI, 0.950–1.000), 0.863 (95 % CI, 0.744–0.982), and 0.822 (95 % CI, 0.668–0.975) in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively, outperforming conventional biomarkers such as CPS, MSI-H, EBV, and HER-2. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differences of survival between high- and low-risk groups, especially in advanced-stage and non-surgical patients. Additionally, genetic analyses revealed that the RPS correlates with enhanced immune regulation pathways and increased infiltration of memory B cells. The interpretable RPS provides accurate predictions for treatment response and prognosis in GC and holds potential for guiding more precise, patient-specific treatment strategies while offering insights into immune-related mechanisms.},

Methods: We prospectively enrolled 208 plasma samples collected at three time points (before PST, after 2 cycles of treatment, before surgery) of 72 patients with stage Ⅱ-III breast cancer. Somatic mutations in plasma samples were identified using a customized 128-gene capture panel with next-generation sequencing. The correlation between early change in ctDNA levels and treatment response or long-term clinical outcomes was assessed. Results: 37 of 72 (51.4%) patients harbored detectable ctDNA alterations at baseline. Patients with complete response showed a larger decrease in ctDNA levels during PST. The median relative change of variant allele fraction (VAF) was −97.4%, −46.7%, and +21.1% for patients who subsequently had a complete response (n = 11), partial response (n = 11), and no response (n = 15) (p = 0.0012), respectively. In addition, the relative change of VAF between the pretreatment and first on-treatment blood draw exhibited the optimal predictive value to tumor response after PST (area under the curve, AUC = 0.7448, p = 0.02). More importantly, early change of ctDNA levels during treatment have significant prognostic value for patients with BC, there was a significant correlation between early decrease of VAF and longer recurrence-free survival compared to those with an VAF increase (HR = 12.54; 95% CI, 2.084 to 75.42, p = 0.0063). Conclusion: Early changes of ctDNA are strongly correlated with therapeutic efficacy to PST and clinical outcomes in BC patients. The integration of preoperative ctDNA evaluation could help improving the perioperative management for BC patients receiving PST.},

  abstract={Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers amongst women, caused by uncontrolled cell growth in breast tissue. Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) proteins play a vital role in regulating normal breast cell development and division, and the status is crucial for determining prognosis and treatment strategies. Despite the availability of various techniques to identify the HER2 gene in tumors, the prediction accuracy of existing methods remains insufficient. This research aims to improve HER2 status prediction accuracy by proposing an Enhanced Hybrid Model with Optimized Attention Network (EHMOA-net) for histopathology image analysis. The methodology involves patch segmentation using an Encoder-Decoder-based hybrid weights alignment with Multi-Dilated U-net (EDMDU) model applied to the TCGA dataset, followed by preprocessing through enhanced Macenko stain normalization for segmented patches and images from the BCI dataset. Improved non-subsampled shearlet transform is utilized for feature extraction, and the Hybrid Enhanced Rough k-means clustering and Fuzzy C-Means (HERFCM) algorithm is employed to cluster neighboring image patches based on similar features. Finally, HER2 prediction is performed using nested graph neural networks integrated with a visual attention network. The proposed method, implemented in Python, achieves an accuracy of 97.85 %, surpassing existing techniques. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of EHMOA-net in improving HER2 prediction accuracy and its potential utility in clinical applications.},

  abstract={Background: To develop radiogenomic subtypes and determine the relationships between radiomic phenotypes and multiomics molecular characteristics. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective multicohort analysis, we divided patients into different subgroups based on multiomics features. This unsupervised subtyping process was performed by integrating 10 unsupervised machine learning algorithms. We compared the variations in clinicopathological, radiomic, genomic, and transcriptomic features across different subgroups. Based on the key radiomic features of subtypes, overall survival (OS) prediction models were developed and validated by using 10 supervised machine learning algorithms. Model performance was evaluated by using the C-index and log-rank test. Results: This study included 2,281 patients (mean age, 63 years ±13 [SD]; 660 females, 1,621 males) for analysis. Patients were divided into four subgroups on the basis of radiogenomic data. Significant differences in OS were observed among the subgroups. Subtypes were significantly different when radiomic phenotypes, gene mutation status and transcriptomic pathway alterations were considered. Among the 24 radiomic features important for subtyping, 9 were closely associated with OS. Machine learning algorithms were used to develop prognostic models and showed moderate OS prediction performance in the training (log-rank P<0.001) and test (log-rank P<0.001) cohorts. Tumor molecular heterogeneity is also closely related to the radiomic phenotype. Conclusions: Biologically interpretable radiomic features provide an effective and novel algorithm for tumor molecular capture and risk stratification.},

Scoring of tumor-CD8+ T cell interactions identifies patients with inflamed tumors and high HLADR expression. We combine these features in multi-omics analyses of 8 cohorts with 3737 patients across all molecular subtypes to propose five prognostic breast cancer subtypes distinguished by tumor cytokeratin expression profiles and CD8+ T cell spatial patterns. This stratification scheme has direct clinical implications: inflamed tumors show good prognosis and high immunotherapy response rates, whereas patients dominated by basoluminal tumor cells have poor prognosis.},

  abstract={Introduction: To develop an image-based deep learning model for predicting pathological response in rectal cancer using post-chemoradiotherapy magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and methods: A total of 466 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection were collected from single center, among whom 113 (24.3%) were allocated to the holdout testing set. Complete response (pCR) was defined as Dworak tumor regression grade (TRG) 4, while good response (GR) was defined as TRG 3 or 4. Based on post-chemoradiotherapy T2-weighted axial MR images, two deep learning models were developed to predict pCR and GR, respectively. The prediction performance of the deep learning models was evaluated in the testing set and was compared to that of a senior radiologist and a radiation oncologist. Results: The deep learning model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 0.76, 0.30, 0.96, 0.67, 0.87, and 85.0% for predicting pCR and 0.72, 0.54, 0.81, 0.60, 0.77, and 71.7% for predicting GR, respectively. The deep learning model had a superior predictive performance than the observers. Fair agreement between the ground truth and the model was shown for pCR prediction (kappa = 0.34) and GR prediction (kappa = 0.36). Conclusions: The post-chemoradiotherapy T2-weighted axial MR image-based deep learning model showed acceptable performance in predicting pCR or GR in patients with rectal cancer, compared with human observers.},

  abstract={Precise prognostic classification of patients and identifying survival subgroups and their associated genes can be important clinical references when designing treatment strategies for cancer patients. Multi-omics and data integration techniques are powerful tools to achieve this goal. This study aimed to introduce a machine learning method to integrate three types of biological data, and investigate the performance of two other methods, in identifying the survival dependency of patients. The data included TCGA RNA-seq gene expression, DNA methylation, and clinical data from 368 patients with colon cancer also we use an independent external validation data set, containing 232 samples. Three methods including, hyper-parameter optimized autoencoders (HPOAE), normal autoencoder, and penalized principal component analysis (PPCA) were used for simultaneous data integration and estimation under a COX hazards model. The HPOAE was thought to outperform other methods. The HPOAE had the Log Rank Mantel-Cox value of 14.27 ± 2, and a Breslow-Generalized Wilcoxon value of 13.13 ± 1. Ten miRNA, 11 methylated genes, and 28 mRNA all by (importance of marginal cutoff > 0.95) were identified. The study demonstrated that hsa-miR-485-5p targets both ZMYM1 and tp53, the latter of which has been previously associated with cancer in numerous studies. Furthermore, compared to other methods, the HPOAE exhibited a greater capacity for identifying survival subgroups and the genes associated with them in patients with colon cancer. However, all of the results were obtained by computational methods, and clinical and experimental studies are needed to validate these results.},

  abstract={Background/objectives: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in chemosensitivity through their biological activities in various malignancies, including pancreatic cancer (PC). However, single-miRNA models offer limited predictability of treatment response. We investigated whether a multiple-miRNA prediction model optimized via machine learning could improve treatment response prediction. Methods: A total of 20 and 66 patients who underwent curative resection for PC after gemcitabine-based preoperative treatment were included in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. Patients were classified according to their response to preoperative treatment. In the discovery cohort, miRNA microarray and machine learning were used to identify candidate miRNAs (in peripheral plasma exosomes obtained before treatment) associated with treatment response. In the validation cohort, miRNA expression was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to validate its ability to predict treatment response. Results: In the discovery cohort, six and three miRNAs were associated with good and poor responders, respectively. The combination of these miRNAs significantly improved predictive accuracy compared with using each single miRNA, with area under the curve (AUC) values increasing from 0.485 to 0.672 to 0.909 for good responders and from 0.475 to 0.606 to 0.788 for poor responders. In the validation cohort, improved predictive performance of the miRNA combination over single-miRNA prediction models was confirmed, with AUC values increasing from 0.461 to 0.669 to 0.777 for good responders and from 0.501 to 0.556 to 0.685 for poor responders. Conclusions: Peripheral blood miRNA profiles using an optimized combination of miRNAs may provide a more advanced prediction model for preoperative treatment response in PC.},

  abstract={Background: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive and rare phenotype of breast cancer, which has a poor prognosis. Thus, it is necessary to establish a novel predictive model of high accuracy for the prognosis of IBC patients. Methods: Clinical information of 1,230 IBC patients from 2010 to 2020 was extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Cox analysis was applied to identify clinicopathological characteristics associated with the overall survival (OS) of IBC patients. Random survival forest (RSF) algorithm was adopted to construct an accurate prognostic prediction model for IBC patients. Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed for survival analyses. Results: Race, N stage, M stage, molecular subtype, history of chemotherapy and surgery, and response to neoadjuvant therapy were identified as independent predictive factors for the OS of IBC patients. The top five significant variables included surgery, response to neoadjuvant therapy, chemotherapy, breast cancer molecular subtypes, and M stage. The C-index of RSF model was 0.7704 and the area under curve (AUC) values for 1, 3, 5 years in training and validation datasets were 0.879–0.955, suggesting the excellent predictive performance of RSF model. IBC patients were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group according the risk score of RSF model, and the OS of patients in the low-risk group was significantly longer than those in the high-risk group. Conclusion: In this study, we constructed a prognosis prediction model for IBC patients through RSF algorithm, which may potentially serve as a useful tool during clinical decision-making.},

  abstract={Reliable blood-based tests for identifying early-stage breast cancer remain elusive. Employing single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis, we illustrate a close correlation between nucleotide metabolism in the breast cancer and activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment, which shows distinctions between subtypes of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC, and is likely to impact cancer prognosis through the A2AR-Treg pathway. Combining machine learning with absolute quantitative metabolomics, we have established an effective approach to the early detection of breast cancer, utilizing a four-metabolite panel including inosine and uridine. This metabolomics study, involving 1111 participants, demonstrates high accuracy across the training, test, and independent validation cohorts. Inosine and uridine prove predictive of the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with TNBC. This study deepens our understanding of nucleotide metabolism in breast cancer development and introduces a promising non-invasive method for early breast cancer detection and predicting NAC response in patients with TNBC.},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: Accurately predicting the pathological response to chemotherapy before treatment is important for selecting the appropriate treatment groups, formulating individualized treatment plans, and improving the survival rates of patients with gastric cancer (GC). Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 151 patients diagnosed with GC who underwent preoperative chemotherapy and surgical resection at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University between January 2015 and June 2023. Both pretreatment-enhanced computer technology images and whole slide images of pathological hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were available for each patient. The image features were extracted and used to construct an ensemble radiopathomics machine learning model. In addition, a nomogram was developed by combining the imaging features and clinical characteristics. Results: In total, 962 radiomics and 999 pathomics signatures were extracted from 106 patients in the training cohort. A fusion radiopathomics model was constructed using 13 radiomics and 5 pathomics signatures. The fusion model showed favorable performance compared to single-omics models, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.789 in the validation cohort. Moreover, a combined radiopathomics nomogram (RPN) was developed based on radiopathomics features and the Borrmann type, which is a classification method for advanced GC according to tumor growth pattern and gross morphology. The RPN showed superior predictive performance in the training (AUC 0.880) and validation cohorts (AUC 0.797). The decision curve analysis showed that RPN could provide favorable clinical benefits to patients with GC. Conclusions: RPN was able to predict the pathological response to preoperative chemotherapy with high accuracy, and therefore provides a novel tool for personalized treatment of GC.},

  abstract={Background: Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women worldwide. Patients who do not achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) or a clinical complete response (cCR) post–neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) typically have a worse prognosis compared to those who do achieve these responses. Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate a random survival forest (RSF) model to predict survival risk in patients with breast cancer who do not achieve a pCR or cCR post-NAC. Methods: We analyzed patients with no pCR/cCR post-NAC treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January 2019 to 2023, with external validation in Duke University and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cohorts. RSF and Cox regression models were compared using the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), the concordance index (C-index), and risk stratification. Results: The study cohort included 306 patients with breast cancer, with most aged 40-60 years (204/306, 66.7%). The majority had invasive ductal carcinoma (290/306, 94.8%), with estrogen receptor (ER)+ (182/306, 59.5%), progesterone receptor (PR)–(179/306, 58.5%), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ (94/306, 30.7%) profiles. Most patients presented with T2 (185/306, 60.5%), N1 (142/306, 46.4%), and M0 (295/306, 96.4%) staging (TNM meaning “tumor, node, metastasis”), with 17.6% (54/306) experiencing disease progression during a median follow-up of 25.9 months (IQR 17.2-36.3). External validation using Duke (N=94) and SEER (N=2760) cohorts confirmed consistent patterns in age (40-60 years: 59/94, 63%, vs 1480/2760, 53.6%), HER2+ rates (26/94, 28%, vs 935/2760, 33.9%), and invasive ductal carcinoma prevalence (89/94, 95%, vs 2506/2760, 90.8%). In the internal cohort, the RSF achieved significantly higher time-dependent AUCs compared to Cox regression at 1-year (0.811 vs 0.763), 3-year (0.834 vs 0.783), and 5-year (0.810 vs 0.771) intervals (overall C-index: 0.803, 95% CI 0.747-0.859, vs 0.736, 95% CI 0.673-0.799). External validation confirmed robust generalizability: the Duke cohort showed 1-, 3-, and 5-year AUCs of 0.912, 0.803, and 0.776, respectively, while the SEER cohort maintained consistent performance with AUCs of 0.771, 0.729, and 0.702, respectively. Risk stratification using the RSF identified 25.8% (79/306) high-risk patients and a significantly reduced survival time (P<.001). Notably, the RSF maintained improved net benefits across decision thresholds in decision curve analysis (DCA); similar results were observed in external studies. The RSF model also showed promising performance across different molecular subtypes in all datasets. Based on the RSF predicted scores, patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups, with notably poorer survival outcomes observed in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group. Conclusions: The RSF model, based solely on clinicopathological variables, provides a promising tool for identifying high-risk patients with breast cancer post-NAC. This approach may facilitate personalized treatment strategies and improve patient management in clinical practice.},

  abstract={Purpose: Image registration plays a vital role in spatially aligning multiple MRI scans for better longitudinal assessment of tumor morphological features. The objective was to evaluate the effect of registration accuracy of six established deformable registration methods(ANTs, DRAMMS, ART, NiftyReg, SSD-FFD, and NMI-FFD) on the predictive value of extracted radiomic features when modeling recurrence-free-survival(RFS) for women after neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NAC) for locally advanced breast cancer. Methods: 130 women had DCE-MRI scans available from the first two visits in the ISPY1/ACRIN-6657 cohort. We calculated the transformation field from each of the different deformable registration methods, and used it to compute voxel-wise parametric-response-maps(PRM) for established four kinetic features.104-radiomic features were computed from each PRM map to characterize intra-tumor heterogeneity. We evaluated performance for RFS using Cox-regression, C-statistic, and Kaplan-Meier(KM) plots. Results: A baseline model(F1:Age, Race, and Hormone-receptor-status) had a 0.54 C-statistic, and model F2(baseline + functional-tumor-volume at early treatment visit(FTV2)) had 0.63. The F2+ANTs had the highest C-statistic(0.72) with the smallest landmark differences(5.40±4.40mm) as compared to other models. The KM curve for model F2 gave p=0.004 for separation between women above and below the median hazard compared to the model F1(p=0.31). A models augmented with radiomic features, also achieved significant KM curve separation(p<0.001) except the F2+ART model. Conclusion: Incorporating image registration in quantifying changes in tumor heterogeneity during NAC can improve prediction of RFS. Radiomic features of PRM maps derived from warping the DCE-MRI kinetic maps using ANTs registration method further improved the early prediction of RFS as compared to other methods.},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate a simplified scoring system by integrating MRI and clinicopathologic features for preoperative prediction of axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in clinically node-positive breast cancer. Materials and Methods: A total of 389 patients from three hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. To identify independent predictors for axillary pCR, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed on pre- and post-NAC MRI and clinicopathologic features. Then, a simplified scoring system was constructed based on regression coefficients of predictors in the multivariable model, and its predictive performance was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration curve. The added value of the scoring system for reducing false-negative rate (FNR) of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was also evaluated. Results: The simplified scoring system including seven predictors: progesterone receptor-negative (Three points), HER2-positive (Two points), post-NAC clinical T0-1 stage (Two points), pre-NAC higher ADC value of breast tumor (One point), absence of perinodal infiltration at pre-NAC (One point) and post-NAC MRI (Two points), and absence of enhancement in the tumor bed at post-NAC MRI (Two points), showed good calibration and discrimination, with AUCs of 0.835, 0.828 and 0.798 in the training, internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The axillary pCR rates were increased with the total points of the scoring system, and patients with a score of ≥11 points had a pCR rate of 86%-100%. In test cohorts for simulating clinical application, the diagnostic accuracy for axillary pCR was 80%-90% among four different radiologists. Compared to standalone SLNB, combining the scoring system with SLNB reduced the FNR from 14.5% to 4.8%. Conclusion: The clinicopathologic-image scoring system with good predictive performance for axillary pCR in clinically node-positive breast cancer, may guide axillary management after NAC and improve patient selection for de-escalating axillary surgery to reduce morbidity.},

  abstract={Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is an essential biomarker to predict immunotherapy response. TMB measurement is mainly conducted by whole-exome sequencing, which is extremely costly and difficult to apply widely in clinical practice. In this study, we present the first deep learning (DL) approach to not only identify aggressive and non-aggressive endometrial cancer (EC) but also predict TMB status directly from histopathology slides with evaluation on a large EC cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) platform. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved excellent performances in both classification of aggressive and non-aggressive ECs and TMB prediction in the aggressive EC and top-ranked performance in comparison with five SOTA DL methods. Interestingly, K-M disease-free survival (DFS) analysis shows that the proposed method successfully differentiates patients having longer DFS with a significant difference (p=0.013) between the TMB predicted classes in the non-aggressive EC. A run time analysis shows that the proposed method performs high efficiency in the prediction time (0.37 s per slide), making the proposed framework achievable for practical clinical usage. These results highlight the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed model to identify aggressive ECs and further predict the TMB status directly from histopathology slides.},

The present aimed to investigate the role of MAGiC parameters of relaxation time (T1), transverse relaxation time (T2) and proton density (PD) to predict the treatment efficacy of breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: The present prospective cohort study enrolled 120 breast cancer patients who received NAC during 2021–2023. Demographic data and clinical characteristics including tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, pathological type, molecular classification and lymph node metastasis were collected. The levels of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) were measured. Patients were divided by treatment efficacy using the Miller-Payne grading as partial pathological response (pPR) group and pathological complete response (pCR). The values of MAGiC parameters of longitudinal T1, T2, and PD values were recorded. Results: In all 120 patients, 73 (60.83%) cases were with pPR and 47 (39.17%) cases were with pCR after treatment. T2 values were markedly lower in pPR patients compared with pCR patients. However, no significant difference was found for T1 and PD values. No significant correlation was observed between any of MAGiC parameters and HER-2, ER or PR. ROC curve showed T2 could be used for prediction of pPR with AUC 0.780. Lymph node metastasis and low levels of T2 were found as independent risk factors for pPR after treatment. Conclusion: The T2 value parameter from MAGiC is an independent risk factor for pPR following NAC in breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting treatment efficacy.},

  abstract={Background and objective: Immunotherapy holds promise in enhancing pathological complete response rates in breast cancer, albeit confined to a select cohort of patients. Consequently, pinpointing factors predictive of treatment responsiveness is of paramount importance. Gene expression and regulation, inherently operating within intricate networks, constitute fundamental molecular machinery for cellular processes and often serve as robust biomarkers. Nevertheless, contemporary feature selection approaches grapple with two key challenges: opacity in modeling and scarcity in accounting for gene-gene interactions Methods: To address these limitations, we devise a novel feature selection methodology grounded in cooperative game theory, harmoniously integrating with sophisticated machine learning models. This approach identifies interconnected gene regulatory network biomarker modules with priori genetic linkage architecture. Specifically, we leverage Shapley values on network to quantify feature importance, while strategically constraining their integration based on network expansion principles and nodal adjacency, thereby fostering enhanced interpretability in feature selection. We apply our methods to a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of breast cancer immunotherapy responses, using the identified feature gene set as biomarkers. Functional enrichment analysis with independent validations further illustrates their effective predictive performance Results: We demonstrate the sophistication and excellence of the proposed method in data with network structure. It unveiled a cohesive biomarker module encompassing 27 genes for immunotherapy response. Notably, this module proves adept at precisely predicting anti-PD1 therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer patients with classification accuracy of 0.905 and AUC value of 0.971, underscoring its unique capacity to illuminate gene functionalities Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for identifying network module biomarkers, and the detected anti-PD1 response biomarkers can enrich our understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms of immunotherapy, which have a promising application for realizing precision medicine.},

  abstract={Objectives: To evaluate the role of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging radiomics features in predicting early recurrence of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and to investigate their correlation with patient prognosis. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 145 patients with PCNSL who were treated with high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy. Clinical data and MRI images were collected, with tumor regions segmented using ITK-SNAP software. Radiomics features were extracted via Pyradiomics, and predictive models were developed using various machine learning algorithms. The predictive performance of these models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Additionally, Cox regression analysis was employed to identify risk factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS). Results: In the cohort of 145 PCNSL patients (72 recurrence, 73 non-recurrence), clinical characteristics were comparable between groups except for multiple lesion frequency (61.1% vs. 39.7%, p < 0.05) and not receiving consolidation therapy (44.4% vs. 13.7%, p < 0.05). A total of 2392 radiomics features were extracted from CET1 and T2WI MRI sequence. Combining clinical variables, 10 features were retained after the feature selection process. The logistic regression (LR) model exhibited superior predictive performance in the test set to predict PCNSL early relapse, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.887 (95 % confidence interval: 0.785–0.988). Multivariate Cox regression identified the Cli-Rad score as an independent prognostic factor for PFS. Significant difference in PFS was observed between high- and low-risk groups defined by Cli-Rad score (8.24 months vs. 24.17 months, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The LR model based on multimodal MRI radiomics and clinical features, can effectively predict early recurrence of PCNSL, while the Cli-Rad score could independently forecast PFS among PCNSL patients.},

  abstract={For patients diagnosed with breast cancer who are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, predicting the response of the tumor to treatment is critical, as it enables the initiation of new therapies and improves patient care. In this context, dynamic contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is the most common imaging modality for assessing tumor response during breast cancer treatment. However, the visual inspection of a patient's tumor from DCE-MRI images by a specialist is a complex and repetitive task, due to the need to analyze high numbers of images, which makes the process exhausting and prone to error. Thus, this work presents a new methodology for predicting the response of a breast tumor to treatment, using four main steps: (i) segmentation of the tumor from DCE-MRI images of the breast; (ii) generation of tumor habitats from segmented DCE-MRI images; (iii) classification of the malignancy of tumor habitats; and (iv) prediction of the response of the breast tumor to treatment, based on the tumor habitats generated. The proposed methodology was tested on the public QIN Breast DCE-MRI dataset, and achieved a Dice score of 92.89% for tumor segmentation, an accuracy of 100% for the classification of malignancy, and an accuracy of 100% in terms of predicting the response of the tumor to the treatment applied. The results presented here demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, which can be integrated into a support system for treating patients with breast cancer.},

  abstract={Background: The TCbHP regimen, consisting of combining docetaxel (T), carboplatin (Cb), trastuzumab (H), and pertuzumab (P), is the preferred neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. However, about 40 % of patients develop resistance to this treatment. Adding TKIs like pyrotinib to anti-HER2 antibodies may enhance efficacy and reduce resistance, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. Methods: Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analyzed tissues from 26 patients treated with NeoPICD (docetaxel, carboplatin, pyrotinib, inetetamab) and 21 patients treated with TCbHP. Cellular changes and spatial relationships were assessed pre- and post-treatment. A co-culture system of tumor cells, fibroblasts, and PBMCs were used to examined cytotoxic T-cell function. A predictive model for treatment outcomes was constructed based on these results. Results: In TCbHP-sensitive patients, IDOhiHLA-DRhi epithelial cells expressing PD-L1 were enriched and interacted with Ki67+ T cells and M1 macrophages. In TCbHP-resistant patients, fibroblasts formed a barrier that hindered immune cell access, critical for resistance. NeoPICD disrupted this barrier, enhancing immune cell infiltration and alleviating resistance. Machine learning based on spatial cell architecture can predict treatment outcomes. Conclusion: Spatial organization of cellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) provides insights into prognosis beyond pathological subtypes. The role of NeoPICD in disruption of fibroblast barriers and enhancement of immune cell function suggests therapeutic advantages in overcoming resistance to anti-HER2 therapies. This research offers new strategies for precision treatment of locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.},

  abstract={Objective: To investigate whether radiomic features obtained from the intratumoral and peritumoral regions of pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can predict progression in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in comparison with the previously determined clinical score. Methods: This single-center retrospective study evaluated 224 women with TNBC who underwent NAC between 2010 and 2019. Women were randomly allocated to the training set (n = 169) for model development and the test set (n = 55) for model validation. The clinical score consisted of the histologic type, Ki-67 index, and degree of edema on T2-weighted imaging. Intratumoral and peritumoral radiomic features were extracted from T2-weighted images and the first- and last-phase images of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. The radiomics model was built using only radiomic features, whereas the combined model incorporated the clinical score along with radiomic features. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Results: Progression occurred in 18 and five patients in the training and test sets, respectively. The radiomics model selected three radiomic features (two peritumoral and one intratumoral), while the combined model selected the clinical score and five radiomic features (four peritumoral and one intratumoral). Among the total radiomic features, Inverse Difference Normalized of the peritumoral region of the T2-weighted images, reflective of peritumoral heterogeneity, demonstrated the highest level of association with tumor progression. In the test set, the AUC values of the radiomics-only model, the combined model, and the clinical score were 0.592, 0.764, and 0.720, respectively. Compared to the clinical score, the radiomics-only model (0.720 vs. 0.592, p = 0.468) and the combined model (0.720 vs. 0.764, p = 0.553) did not show superior performance. Conclusion: The radiomics features were not superior in predicting the progression of TNBC compared to the clinical score, although the peritumoral heterogeneity on T2-weighted images showed a potential.},

Methods: A total of 154 primary BC with equivocal IHC results for HER2 were retrospectively enrolled in the study. First, the following five conventional PET parameters (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, MTV, TLG) were measured and compared between HER2-positive and HER2-negative cohorts. After quantitative radiomic features extraction and reduction, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to establish a radiomic signature model. Then, the area under the curve (AUCs) after a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated and used as the main outcomes. Finally, a total of 37 BC patients from an external institution were included to perform an external validation. Results: All the five conventional PET parameters were unable to discriminate between HER2-positive and HER2-negative cohorts for BC (P = 0.104–0.544). Whereas, the developed radiomic signature model was potentially predictive of HER2 status with an of AUC 0.887 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.824–0.950) in the training cohort and 0.766 (95% CI, 0.616–0.916) in the validation cohort, respectively. For external validation, the AUC for the external test cohort was 0.788 (95% CI, 0.633–0.944). Conclusions: Radiomic signature based on 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT images was capable of non-invasively predicting the HER2 status with a comparable ability to FISH assay, especially for those with equivocal IHC results for HER2.},

Machine learning techniques hold immense promise for better drug response predictions, but most have not reached clinical practice due to their lack of interpretability and their focus on monotherapies. We address these challenges by developing DrugCell, an interpretable deep learning model of human cancer cells trained on the responses of 1,235 tumor cell lines to 684 drugs. Tumor genotypes induce states in cellular subsystems that are integrated with drug structure to predict response to therapy and, simultaneously, learn biological mechanisms underlying the drug response. DrugCell predictions are accurate in cell lines and also stratify clinical outcomes. Analysis of DrugCell mechanisms leads directly to the design of synergistic drug combinations, which we validate systematically by combinatorial CRISPR, drug-drug screening in vitro, and patient-derived xenografts. DrugCell provides a blueprint for constructing interpretable models for predictive medicine.},

  abstract={Breast cancer (BC) remains a predominant and deadly cancer in women worldwide. By 2040, projections indicate that more than 3 million new cases of breast cancer will emerge annually, culminating in more than 1 million deaths worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of BC are critical factors that influence treatment success and patient outcomes. During the past three decades, several medical imaging modalities, such as X-ray Mammography (MG), Ultrasound (US), Computer Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Digital Tomosynthesis (DT) have been explored to support radiologists/physicians in clinical decision-making workflows for the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of BC. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an advanced imaging modality that provides detailed information on the structure and function of breast tissue. In particular, MRI may be crucial to discern the phenotype of BC, as each subtype has a different prognosis and requires different treatment strategies. This study aims to explore deep learning models for classifying/diagnosing BC phenotypes. As a main contribution, we propose a new 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on quantitative medical imaging biomarkers (QIB) obtained from MRI data to diagnose the luminal A subtype (LA) of BC. LA is a subtype characterized by positive hormone receptor expression and negative HER2 expression. It uses a binary classification strategy to distinguish between pathological luminal A and non-luminal A lesions by analyzing 3D volumetric MRI images. The proposed method allows the extraction and analysis of spatial information, which is essential to accurately diagnose BC, especially for the LA subtype, taking into account their specific morphological characteristics. Our goal is to improve accuracy and efficacy in the diagnosis of the LA phenotype of BC and to contribute to the development of personalized treatment plans for patients. To develop and evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we used a benchmarking public domain MRI-based BC dataset (Duke-Breast-Cancer-MRI). To address the imbalance in the data set, we implemented a class weighting strategy during model training. In experimental settings, we achieved an AUC score of 0.9614 and a F1 score of 0.9328, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, including ResNet-152. These results demonstrate the potential of our work to significantly improve the diagnosis of the luminal A phenotype of breast cancer, paving the way for more accurate and personalized treatment strategies.},

  abstract={Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a crucial component of treatment for locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), only about 70% of patients respond to it. Effective adjustment of NAC for individual patients can significantly improve survival rates of those resistant to standard regimens. Thus, the early prediction of NAC outcome is of great importance in facilitating a personalized paradigm for breast cancer therapeutics. In this study, quantitative computed tomography (qCT) parametric imaging in conjunction with machine learning techniques were investigated to predict LABC tumor response to NAC. Textural and second derivative textural (SDT) features of CT images of 72 patients diagnosed with LABC were analysed before the initiation of NAC to quantify intra-tumor heterogeneity. These quantitative features were processed through a correlation-based feature reduction followed by a sequential feature selection with a bootstrap 0.632+ area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC0.632+) criterion. The best feature subset consisted of a combination of one textural and three SDT features. Using these features, an AdaBoost decision tree could predict the patient response with a cross-validated AUC0.632+ accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.88, 85%, 88% and 75%, respectively. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that a combination of textural and SDT features of CT images can be used to predict breast cancer response NAC prior to the start of treatment which can potentially facilitate early therapy adjustments.},

  abstract={Purpose: To investigate the potential of radiomics signatures (RSs) from intratumoral and peritumoral regions on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to noninvasively evaluate HER2 status in breast cancer. Method: In this retrospective study, 992 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancers who underwent preoperative MRI were enrolled. The breast cancer lesions were segmented manually, and the intratumor region of interest (ROIIntra) was dilated by 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm (ROIPeri2mm, ROIPeri4mm, ROIPeri6mm, and ROIPeri8mm, respectively). Quantitative radiomics features were extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (DCE-T1), fat-saturated T2-weighted imaging (T2) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). A three-step procedure was performed for feature selection, and RSs were constructed using a support vector machine (SVM) to predict HER2 status. Result: The best single-area RSs for predicting HER2 status were DCE_Peri4mm-RS, T2_Peri4mm-RS, and DWI_Peri4mm-RS, yielding areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.716 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.648–0.778), 0.706 (95% CI, 0.637–0.768), and 0.719 (95% CI, 0.651–0.780), respectively, in the test set. The optimal RSs combining intratumoral and peritumoral regions for evaluating HER2 status were DCE-T1_Intra + DCE_Peri4mm-RS, T2_Intra + T2_Peri6mm-RS and DWI_Intra + DWI_Peri4mm-RS, with AUCs of 0.752 (95% CI, 0.686–0.810), 0.754 (95% CI, 0.688–0.812) and 0.725 (95% CI, 0.657–0.786), respectively, in the test set. Combining three sequences in the ROIIntra, ROIPeri2mm, ROIPeri4mm, ROIPeri6mm and ROIPeri8mm areas, the optimal RS was DCE-T1_Peri4mm + T2_Peri4mm + DWI_Peri4mm-RS, achieving an AUC of 0.795 (95% CI, 0.733–0.849) in the test set. Conclusion: This study systematically explored the influence of the intratumoral region, different peritumoral sizes and their combination in radiomics analysis for predicting HER2 status in breast cancer based on multiparametric MRI and found the optimal RS.},

  abstract={Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) represents a non-invasive treatment paradigm for both locally advanced and early-stage breast cancer patients. Precise prediction of NACT treatment response is pivotal in postoperative treatment planning and prognostic enhancement. While pathologic puncture remains a central method for evaluating NACT response, its invasive nature not only induces adverse effects but also elevates the risk of delayed surgery. To this end, this paper proposes CITR-Net, an innovative multi-modality fusion framework which ingeniously combines Clinicopathologic Information with Tumor Region characteristics to achieve precise prediction of NACT treatment response. Leveraging a dual-stream encoder with paralleled parameter-shared attention (P2SA) gates, CITR-Net adeptly captures both texture and intensity features from tumor regions before and after contrast agent injection. Simultaneously, clinicopathologic information extracted from clinical and pathology tabular data is tokenized to facilitate feature representation. A novel clinicopathologic information-enhanced feature fusion (CIF-Fusion) strategy seamlessly merges these feature representations, enabling a comprehensive exploration of tumor-related features across image and tabular data domains. Furthermore, CITR-Net employs a tumor region-based decoder, guided by a tumor region-supervised loss, to ensure intricate details of tumor areas are preserved during the encoding phase. Experimental evaluations conducted on two publicly available datasets demonstrate CITR-Net's superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. In summary, CITR-Net emerges as a efficient and effective tool for accurately predicting NACT treatment response, paving the way for improved patient care and prognostic outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: To develop a monitoring model using radiomics analysis based on longitudinal B-mode ultrasound (BUS) and shear wave elastography (SWE) to early predict pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 112 breast cancer patients who received NAC between September 2016 and March 2022 were included. The BUS and SWE data of breast cancer were obtained prior to treatment as well as after two and four cycles of NAC. Radiomics features were extracted followed by measuring the changes in radiomics features compared to baseline after the second and fourth cycles of NAC (△R [C2], △R [C4]), respectively. The delta radiomics signatures were established using a support vector machine classifier. Results: The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of △RBUS (C2) and △RBUS (C4) for predicting the response to NAC were 0.83 and 0.84, while those of △RSWE (C2) and △RSWE (C4) were 0.88 and 0.90, respectively. △RSWE exhibited significantly superior performance to △RBUS for predicting NAC response (Delong test, p < 0.01). No significant differences were observed in the performances between △R (C2) and △R (C4) based on BUS or SWE data. The longitudinal dual-modal ultrasound radiomics (LDUR) model had an excellent discrimination, good calibration and clinical usefulness, with the AUC, sensitivity and specificity of 0.97, 95.52% and 91.11%, respectively. Conclusion: The LDUR model achieved excellent performance in predicting the pathological response to chemotherapy during the early stages of NAC for breast cancer.},

  abstract={Purpose: In high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) the standard of care encompasses multimodal therapy regimens. While there is a growing body of evidence for prognostic pretreatment radiomic models, we hypothesized that temporal changes in radiomic features following neoadjuvant treatment (“delta-radiomics”) may be able to predict the pathological complete response (pCR). Methods: MRI scans (T1-weighted with fat-saturation and contrast-enhancement (T1FSGd) and T2-weighted with fat-saturation (T2FS)) of patients with STS of the extremities and trunk treated with neoadjuvant therapy were gathered from two independent institutions (training: 103, external testing: 53 patients). pCR was defined as <5% viable cells. After segmentation and preprocessing, 105 radiomic features were extracted. Delta-radiomic features were calculated by subtraction of features derived from MRI scans obtained before and after neoadjuvant therapy. After feature reduction, machine learning modeling was performed in 100 iterations of 3-fold nested cross-validation. Delta-radiomic models were compared with single timepoint models in the testing cohort. Results: The combined delta-radiomic models achieved the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75. Pre-therapeutic tumor volume was the best conventional predictor (AUC 0.70). The T2FS-based delta-radiomic model had the most balanced classification performance with a balanced accuracy of 0.69. Delta-radiomic models achieved better reproducibility than single timepoint radiomic models, RECIST or the peri-therapeutic volume change. Delta-radiomic models were significantly associated with survival in multivariate Cox regression. Conclusion: This exploratory analysis demonstrated that MRI-based delta-radiomics improves prediction of pCR over tumor volume and RECIST. Delta-radiomics may one day function as a biomarker for personalized treatment adaptations.},

  abstract={Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative force in oncology, offering unprecedented capabilities in cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis. The integration of DL models with vast and complex datasets, including genomic, transcriptomic, and imaging data, has paved the way for more precise and personalized cancer care. In particular, DL's application in drug efficacy and toxicity prediction is gaining traction, addressing the critical challenge of high drug failure rates in clinical development. By leveraging large datasets and sophisticated algorithms, DL models can predict drug responses and optimize treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Additionally, DL-driven automation in medical imaging processing and report generation is revolutionizing radiology, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and consistency. This review explores the current advancements in DL applications across various aspects of oncology, emphasizing the potential of AI-driven tools to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and personalization of cancer care. Despite the significant progress, challenges such as model validation, ethical considerations, and the need for transparent AI systems remain. Addressing these challenges will be crucial in realizing the full potential of DL in transforming oncology practices.},

  abstract={Background: To use clinical and MRI radiomic features coupled with machine learning to assess HER2 expression level and predict pathologic response (pCR) in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: This retrospective study included 311 patients. pCR was defined as no residual invasive carcinoma in the breast or axillary lymph nodes (ypT0/isN0). Radiomics/statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB and CERR software. After ROC and correlation analysis, selected radiomics parameters were advanced to machine learning modelling alongside clinical MRI-based parameters (lesion type, multifocality, size, nodal status). For predicting pCR, the data was split into a training and test set (80:20). Findings: The overall pCR rate was 60.5% (188/311). The final model to predict HER2 heterogeneity utilised three MRI parameters (two clinical, one radiomic) for a sensitivity of 99.3% (277/279), specificity of 81.3% (26/32), and diagnostic accuracy of 97.4% (303/311). The final model to predict pCR included six MRI parameters (two clinical, four radiomic) for a sensitivity of 86.5% (32/37), specificity of 80.0% (20/25), and diagnostic accuracy of 83.9% (52/62) (test set); these results were independent of age and ER status, and outperformed the best model developed using clinical parameters only (p=0.029, comparison of proportion Chi-squared test). Interpretation: The machine learning models, including both clinical and radiomics MRI features, can be used to assess HER2 expression level and can predict pCR after NAC in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients.

  abstract={Background: For patients with early-stage breast cancers, neoadjuvant treatment is recommended for non-luminal tumors instead of luminal tumors. Preoperative distinguish between luminal and non-luminal cancers at early stages will facilitate treatment decisions making. However, the molecular immunohistochemical subtypes based on biopsy specimens are not always consistent with final results based on surgical specimens due to the high intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Given that, we aimed to develop and validate a deep learning radiopathomics (DLRP) model to preoperatively distinguish between luminal and non-luminal breast cancers at early stages based on preoperative ultrasound (US) images, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy slides. Methods: This multicentre study included three cohorts from a prospective study conducted by our team and registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1900027497). Between January 2019 and August 2021, 1809 US images and 603 H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from 603 patients with early-stage breast cancers were obtained. A Resnet18 model pre-trained on ImageNet and a multi-instance learning based attention model were used to extract the features of US and WSIs, respectively. An US-guided Co-Attention module (UCA) was designed for feature fusion of US and WSIs. The DLRP model was constructed based on these three feature sets including deep learning US feature, deep learning WSIs feature and UCA-fused feature from a training cohort (1467 US images and 489 WSIs from 489 patients). The DLRP model's diagnostic performance was validated in an internal validation cohort (342 US images and 114 WSIs from 114 patients) and an external test cohort (279 US images and 90 WSIs from 90 patients). We also compared diagnostic efficacy of the DLRP model with that of deep learning radiomics model and deep learning pathomics model in the external test cohort. Findings: The DLRP yielded high performance with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.929 (95% CI 0.865–0.968) in the internal validation cohort, and 0.900 (95% CI 0.816–0.953) in the external test cohort. The DLRP also outperformed deep learning radiomics model based on US images only (AUC 0.815 [0.719–0.889], p < 0.027) and deep learning pathomics model based on WSIs only (AUC 0.802 [0.704–0.878], p < 0.013) in the external test cohort. Interpretation: The DLRP can effectively distinguish between luminal and non-luminal breast cancers at early stages before surgery based on pretherapeutic US images and biopsy H&E-stained WSIs, providing a tool to facilitate treatment decision making in early-stage breast cancers.

  abstract={Objective The aim of our study was to evaluate the contribution of 18Fluorine-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FDG PET) radiomic data obtained from both the tumoral and peritumoral area in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods Female patients with a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma who received NAC were evaluated retrospectively. The volume of interest (VOI) of the primary tumor (VOI-T) was manually segmented, then a voxel-thick VOI was added around VOI-T to define the peritumoral area (VOI-PT). Morphological, intensity-based, histogram and texture parameters were obtained from VOIs. The patients were divided into two groups as pCR and non-complete pathological response (npCR). A “radiomic model” was created with only radiomic features, and a “patho-radiomic model” was created using radiomic features and immunohistochemical data. Results Of the 66 patients included in the study, 21 were in the pCR group. The only statistically significant feature from the primary tumor among patients with pCR and npCR was Morphological_Compacity-T (AUC: 0.666). Between response groups, a significant difference was detected in 2 morphological, 1 intensity, 4 texture features from VOI-PT; no correlation was found between Morphological_Compacity-PT and NGTDM_contrast-PT. The obtained radiomic model’s sensitivity and accuracy values were calculated as 61.9% and 75.8%, respectively (AUC: 0.786). When HER2 status was added, sensitivity and accuracy values of the patho-radiomic model increased to 85.7% and 81.8%, respectively (AUC: 0.903). Conclusions Evaluation of PET peritumoral radiomic features together with the primary tumor, rather than just the primary tumor, provides a better prediction of the pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer. Resumen Objetivo El objetivo de nuestro estudio fue evaluar la contribución de los datos radiómicos de la tomografía por emisión de positrones con 18flúor-fluorodesoxiglucosa (PET con 18F-FDG) obtenidos tanto del área tumoral como peritumoral en la predicción de la respuesta patológica completa (pCR) en pacientes con cáncer de mama localmente avanzado que reciben quimioterapia neoadyuvante (NAC). Métodos Se evaluaron retrospectivamente pacientes femeninas con diagnóstico de carcinoma ductal invasivo que recibieron NAC. El volumen de interés (VOI) del tumor primario (VOI-T) se segmentó manualmente, luego se agregó un VOI de espesor de vóxel alrededor de VOI-T para definir el área peritumoral (VOI-PT). Los parámetros morfológicos, basados en intensidad, histogramas y textura se obtuvieron de los VOI. Los pacientes se dividieron en dos grupos: pCR y respuesta patológica no completa (npCR). Se creó un “modelo radiómico” únicamente con características radiómicas y un “modelo pato-radiómico” utilizando características radiómicas y datos inmunohistoquímicos. Resultados De los 66 pacientes incluidos en el estudio, 21 estaban en el grupo pCR. La única característica estadísticamente significativa del tumor primario entre los pacientes con pCR y npCR fue Morphological_Compacity-T (AUC: 0.666). Entre los grupos de respuesta, se detectó una diferencia significativa en 2 características morfológicas, 1 de intensidad y 4 de textura de VOI-PT; no se encontró correlación entre Morphological_Compacity-PT y NGTDM_contrast-PT. Los valores de sensibilidad y precisión del modelo radiómico obtenidos se calcularon como 61.9% y 75.8%, respectivamente (AUC: 0.786). Cuando se agregó el estado de HER2, los valores de sensibilidad y precisión del modelo pato-radiómico aumentaron al 85.7 % y 81.8 %, respectivamente (AUC: 0.903). Conclusiones La evaluación de las características radiómicas peritumorales de la PET junto con el tumor primario, en lugar de solo el tumor primario, proporciona una mejor predicción de la pCR a NAC en pacientes con cáncer de mama.},

  abstract={Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of characterizing tumor heterogeneity in breast cancer ultrasound images using habitat analysis technology and establish a radiomics machine learning model for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: Ultrasound images from patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant therapy at our institution between July 2021 and December 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Initially, the region of interest was delineated and segmented into multiple habitat areas using local feature delineation and cluster analysis techniques. Subsequently, radiomics features were extracted from each habitat area to construct 3 machine learning models. Finally, the model's efficacy was assessed through operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curve evaluation. Results: A total of 945 patients were enrolled, with 333 demonstrating a favorable response to NAC and 612 exhibiting an unfavorable response to NAC. Through the application of habitat analysis techniques, 3 distinct habitat regions within the tumor were identified. Subsequently, a predictive model was developed by incorporating 19 radiomics features, and all 3 machine learning models demonstrated excellent performance in predicting treatment outcomes. Notably, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) exhibited superior performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.872 in the training cohort and 0.740 in the testing cohort. Additionally, DCA and calibration curves were employed for further evaluation. Conclusions: The habitat analysis technique effectively distinguishes distinct biological subregions of breast cancer, while the established radiomics machine learning model predicts NAC response by forecasting residual cancer burden (RCB) classification.},

We used baseline multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and hematoxylin and eosin-stained biopsy slides to extract quantitative feature information and predict the pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Methods: We retrospectively collected data from breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our hospital from August 2016 to January 2018; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging) and whole slide image of hematoxylin and eosin-stained biopsy sections were collected. Quantitative imaging features were extracted from the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and the whole slide image were used to construct a radiopathomics signature model powered by machine learning methods. Models based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging or whole slide image alone were also constructed for comparison and referred to as the radiomics signature and pathomics signature models, respectively. Four modeling methods were used to establish prediction models. Model performances were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and the area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Results: The radiopathomics signature model had favourable performance for the prediction of pathological complete response in the training set (the best value: area under the curve 0.83, accuracy 0.84, and sensitivity 0.87), and in the test set (the best value: area under the curve 0.91, accuracy 0.90, and sensitivity 0.88). In the test set, the radiopathomics signature model also significantly outperformed the radiomics signature (the best value: area under the curve 0.83, accuracy 0.64, and sensitivity 0.62), pathomics signature (the best value: area under the curve 0.60, accuracy 0.74, and sensitivity 0.62) (p > 0.05). Decision curve analysis and calibration curves confirmed the excellent performance of these prediction models in discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that radiopathomics, the combination of both radiological information regarding the whole tumor and pathological information at the cellular level, could potentially predict discrepancies in pathological response and provide evidence for rational treatment plans.},

  abstract={Background: Accurate tumour response prediction to targeted therapy allows for personalised conversion therapy for patients with unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM). In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a multi-modal deep learning model to predict the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with initially unresectable CRLM using baseline PET/CT, clinical data, and colonoscopy biopsy specimens. Methods: In this multicentre cohort study, we retrospectively collected data of 307 patients with CRLM from the BECOME study (NCT01972490) (Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai) and two independent Chinese cohorts (internal validation cohort from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University; external validation cohort from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 at Zhongshan Hospital—Xiamen, Shanghai, and the First Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou). The main inclusion criteria were that patients with CRLM had pre-treatment PET/CT images as well as colonoscopy specimens. After extracting PET/CT features with deep neural networks (DNN) and selecting related clinical factors using LASSO analysis, a random forest classifier was built as the Deep Radiomics Bevacizumab efficacy predicting model (DERBY). Furthermore, by combining histopathological biomarkers into DERBY, we established DERBY+. The performance of model was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Findings: DERBY achieved promising performance in predicting bevacizumab sensitivity with an AUC of 0.77 and 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.67–0.87]. After combining histopathological features, we developed DERBY+, which had more robust accuracy for predicting tumour response in external validation cohort (AUC 0.83 and 95% CI [0.75–0.92], sensitivity 80.4%, specificity 76.8%). DERBY+ also had prognostic value: the responders had longer progression-free survival (median progression-free survival: 9.6 vs 6.3 months, p = 0.002) and overall survival (median overall survival: 27.6 vs 18.5 months, p = 0.010) than non-responders. Interpretation: This multi-modal deep radiomics model, using PET/CT, clinical data and histopathological data, was able to identify patients with bevacizumab-sensitive CRLM, providing a favourable approach for precise patient treatment. To further validate and explore the clinical impact of this work, future prospective studies with larger patient cohorts are warranted.

Method: Overall, 133 lesions from 133 patients who underwent pre-surgical MRI evaluation after neoadjuvant systemic treatment were included. Two readers blinded to the pathological diagnosis evaluated the images. MR images were obtained using a routine protocol sequence that included DWI and DCE-MRI. DWI of the target lesion was scored using a three-point scale. Kinetic patterns of lesions on DCE-MRI were scored using a four-point scale. The capacities of DWI and kinetic parameters for discriminating pCR and non-pCR were assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: For DWI scores, ROC analysis showed areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.77–0.90) and 0.85 (0.77–0.90) for readers 1 and 2, respectively; corresponding AUCs of kinetic scores were 0.89 (0.82–0.94) and 0.88 (0.81–0.93).

Here, we developed Genomic Status scan (GSscan), a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep-learning framework, which utilizes low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to capture genomic instability-related features. In this study, GSscan directly surveys homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status independent of other existing biomarkers. In breast cancer, GSscan achieved an AUC of 0.980 in simulated low-pass WGS data, and obtained a higher HRD risk score in clinical BRCA-deficient breast cancer samples (p = 1.3 × 10−4, compared with BRCA-intact samples). In ovarian cancer, GSscan obtained higher HRD risk scores in BRCA-deficient samples in both simulated data and clinical samples (p = 2.3 × 10−5 and p = 0.039, respectively, compared with BRCA-intact samples). Moreover, HRD-positive patients predicted by GSscan showed longer progression-free intervals in TCGA datasets (p = 0.0011) treated with platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy, outperforming existing low-pass WGS-based methods. Furthermore, GSscan can accurately predict HRD status using only 1 ng of input DNA and a minimum sequencing coverage of 0.02 ×, providing a reliable, accessible, and cost-effective approach. In summary, GSscan effectively and accurately detected HRD status, and provide a broadly applicable framework for disease diagnosis and selecting appropriate disease treatment.},

  abstract={To explore machine learning (ML)-based breast tumor peritumoral (P) and intratumoral ultrasound radiomics signatures (IURS) for predicting axillary response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with breast cancer (BC) with node-positive. A total of 435 patients were divided into hormone receptor (HR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2-, HER2+, and triple-negative (TN) subtypes. ML classifiers including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied to construct PURS, IURS, and the combined P-IURS radiomics models. SVM of the TN subtype obtained the most favorable performance with an AUC of 0.917 (95%CI: 0.859, 0.960) in PURS models, RF of the HER2+ subtype yielded the highest efficacy in IURS models [AUC = 0.935 (95%CI: 0.843, 0.976)]. The RF-based combined P-IURS model of the HER2+ subtype improved the efficacy to a maximum AUC of 0.952 (95%CI: 0.868, 0.994). ML-based US radiomics can be a promising biomarker to predict axillary response.},

  abstract={Breast cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer among women globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), early detection and treatment can significantly reduce surgeries and improve survival rates. Since deep learning emerged in 2012, it has garnered significant research interest in breast cancer, particularly for diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and survival prediction. This review specifically focuses on the application of deep learning to breast image analysis (MRI, mammogram, and ultrasound) with a particular emphasis on radiologist involvement in the evaluation process. Studies published between 2019 and 2024 in the Scopus database will be reviewed. We further explore radiologists’ perspectives on the clinical readiness of artificial intelligence (AI) for breast image analysis. By analyzing insights from published articles, we will discuss the challenges, limitations, and future directions for this evolving field. While the review highlights the promise of deep learning in breast image analysis, it also acknowledges critical issues that must be addressed before widespread clinical integration can be achieved.},

However, current studies mainly rely on single-modal data, with limited studies focusing on multimodal data. In this study, we developed and validated a deep learning-based multimodal fusion model that predicts the response of breast tumor to NAC by integrating multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) information related to breast tumor. For comparison, we separately built four single-modal models with either MR images or RNA-seq data. Moreover, our approach has demonstrated better performance in integrating MR images and RNA-seq data. The average accuracy is 90.20% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is 0.936 for our model.

Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 255 breast cancer patients who received NAC between September 2016 and December 2021 were included. Radiomics models were designed using a support vector machine classifier based on US images obtained before treatment, including BUS and SWE. And CNN models also were developed using ResNet architecture. The final predictive model was developed by combining the dual-modal US and independently associated clinicopathologic characteristics. The predictive performances of the models were assessed with five-fold cross-validation. Results: Pretreatment SWE performed better than BUS in predicting the response to NAC for breast cancer for both the CNN and radiomics models (P < 0.001). The predictive results of the CNN models were significantly better than the radiomics models, with AUCs of 0.72 versus 0.69 for BUS and 0.80 versus 0.77 for SWE, respectively (P = 0.003). The CNN model based on the dual-modal US and molecular data exhibited outstanding performance in predicting NAC response, with an accuracy of 83.60% ± 2.63%, a sensitivity of 87.76% ± 6.44%, and a specificity of 77.45% ± 4.38%. Conclusion: The pretreatment CNN model based on the dual-modal US and molecular data achieved excellent performance for predicting the response to chemotherapy in breast cancer. Therefore, this model has the potential to serve as a non-invasive objective biomarker to predict NAC response and aid clinicians with individual treatments.},

  abstract={Background: Precise evaluation of pathological complete response (pCR) is essential for determining the prognosis of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) and can offer clues for the selection of subsequent treatment strategies. Most current predictive models for pCR focus primarily on pre-treatment factors, neglecting the dynamic systemic changes that occur during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and are constrained by low accuracy and lack of integrity. Purpose: This study devised a novel predictor of pCR using dynamic alterations in systemic inflammation-nutritional marker indexes (SINI) during neoadjuvant therapy and developed a machine-learning model to predict pCR. Methods: Two cohorts of patients with LARC from center one from 2012 to 2017 and from center two from 2020 to 2023 were integrated for analysis. This study compared dynamic changes in blood indexes before and after neoadjuvant therapy and surgical operation. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was conducted to mitigate collinearity and identify key indexes, constructing the SINI. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify the independent risk factors associated with pCR. Additionally, 10 machine learning algorithms were employed to develop predictive models to assess risk. The hyperparameters of the machine learning models were optimized using a random search and 10-fold cross-validation. The models were assessed by examining various metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), decision curve analysis, calibration curves, and the precision and accuracy of the internal and external validation cohorts. Additionally, Shapley's additive explanations (SHAP) were employed to interpret the machine learning models. Results: The study cohort comprised 677 patients from the center one and 224 patients from the center two. Six key indexes were identified, and a predictive index, SINI, was constructed. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that SINI, clinical T-stage, clinical N-stage, tumor size, and the distance from the anal verge were independent risk factors for pCR in patients with LARC following NCRT. The mean AUC value of the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model in the 10-fold cross-validation of the training set was 0.877. The XGB model demonstrated superior performance in the internal and external validation sets. Specifically, in the internal test set, the XGB model achieved an AUC of 0.86, AUPRC of 0.707, accuracy of 0.82, and precision of 0.80. In the external validation set, the XGB model exhibited an AUC of 0.83, AUPRC of 0.702, accuracy of 0.81, and precision of 0.81. Additionally, the predictions generated by the XGB model were analyzed using SHAP. Conclusion: This study involved developing and validating an XGB model using SINI to predict pCR in patients with LARC. Besides, a SINI-based machine learning model shows promise in accurately predicting pCR following NCRT in patients with resectable LARC, offering valuable insights for personalized treatment approaches.},

  abstract={Background: Changes in tumor volume following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) are a crucial reference for determining surgical approaches in breast cancer, especially important for patients desiring breast conservation. Methods: Between September 2015 and July 2022, 118 breast cancer cases from 109 patients were retrospectively gathered and randomly split into two cohorts: a training cohort of 83 cases and a test cohort of 35 cases. Deep learning models with DenseNet-201 architecture were constructed based on the peak enhanced phase of dynamic contrast -enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Deep learning models were created to identify breast cancers that would experience tumor/node (T/N) stage downstaging or more than 90% reduction in MRI volume post-NAC. Their performance was compared with clinical models using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for evaluation. The DeLong 's test was used to determine significant differences in AUC among different models. Results: In the evaluation on a test cohort, a deep learning model showcased significantly better accuracy in predicting the downstaging of T/N stages in breast cancer with an AUC of 0.85. This performance markedly exceeded that of the traditional clinical model, which achieved an AUC of only 0.44. The deep learning model also excelled in predicting cases of breast cancer with more than 90% reduction in MRI volume, achieving an AUC of 0.89. This was superior to the clinical model 's performance, which had an AUC of 0.61. The DeLong 's test results showed that the predictive performance of the deep learning models was significantly better than that of the clinical models ( P both <0.05). Conclusion: The deep learning model developed using DCE-MRI can accurately predict a tumor volume reduction of over 90% and downstaging of T/N stages in breast cancer patients after NAC, thereby potentially facilitating personalized treatment planning.},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate whether HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) (2+)/SISH (silver-enhanced in situ hybridization)+ and HER2 (3+) breast cancers exhibit distinct imaging characteristics on pre-treatment MRI and assess differences in pCR (pathologic complete response) prediction accuracy on post-treatment MRI, considering interobserver variability. Methods: This retrospective study included 301 HER2-positive breast cancer patients (mean age, 54 ± 10 years) who underwent NAC and surgery. Pre-treatment MRI features were analyzed in consensus. Two radiologists independently assessed post-treatment MRI for shrinkage patterns and response according to RECIST v1.1, further categorizing complete responses into rCR (radiologic complete response) and near-rCR. Interobserver agreement was measured (Cohen's kappa), and pCR was defined as no residual invasive or in situ tumor in the breast (ypT0) on the final pathology report. Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were used to evaluate pCR prediction. Results: Fifty-four patients had HER2 (2+)/SISH+ and 247 had HER2 (3+) tumors. pCR rates were significantly higher in HER2 (3+) (58.7% vs. 18.5%, p < 0.001). On pre-treatment MRI, HER2 (2+)/SISH+ tumors more often appeared as single masses, while HER2 (3+) tumors showed more NME (non-mass enhancement) (44.5% vs. 16.7%, p < 0.001) and mass with NME (33.6% vs. 9.3%, p = 0.005). Post-treatment MRI showed simple concentric shrinkage in HER2 (2+)/SISH+ and no enhancement in HER2 (3+). Agreement was moderate (κ = 0.541–0.588). For pCR prediction, rCR alone yielded AUCs ranging from 0.659 to 0.756. Adding near-rCR improved specificity but reduced sensitivity, with a significant AUC increase for one reader (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Pre-treatment MRI revealed distinct imaging characteristics between subgroups. While pCR rates were higher in HER2 (3+), MRI-based pCR prediction showed similar performance, though near-rCR reduced sensitivity.},

  abstract={Objective: The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of CNN-based proposed models for predicting patients' response to NAC treatment and the disease development process in the pathological area. The study aims to determine the main criteria that affect the model's success during training, such as the number of convolutional layers, dataset quality and depended variable. Method: The study uses pathological data frequently used in the healthcare industry to evaluate the proposed CNN-based models. The researchers analyze the classification performances of the models and evaluate their success during training. Results: The study shows that using deep learning methods, particularly CNN models, can offer strong feature representation and lead to accurate predictions of patients' response to NAC treatment and the disease development process in the pathological area. A model that predicts ‘miller coefficient’, ‘tumor lymph node value’, ‘complete response in both tumor and axilla’ values with high accuracy, which is considered to be effective in achieving complete response to treatment, has been created. Estimation performance metrics have been obtained as 87%, 77% and 91%, respectively. Conclusion: The study concludes that interpreting pathological test results with deep learning methods is an effective way of determining the correct diagnosis and treatment method, as well as the prognosis follow-up of the patient. It provides clinicians with a solution to a large extent, particularly in the case of large, heterogeneous datasets that can be challenging to manage with traditional methods.

  abstract={Objective Through the dynamic observation, treatment, and nursing experience of patients with advanced breast cancer, we can accumulate rich clinical experience and do a better job in nursing. Methods Deep learning radiology (DLR) extracted in-depth features from medical images through different frameworks and further analyzed the extracted deep features. The dynamic observation, treatment, and nursing of 50 patients with advanced breast cancer from hospital diagnosis provided patients with rapid, effective, and definite treatment and nursing measures. As a result, 49 patients (99%) were discharged from the hospital with improved and stable conditions. Conclusion Effective treatment and careful nursing for patients with advanced breast cancer as soon as possible will help to improve their quality of life, prolong their life cycle, reduce mortality, and assist clinical practice. Results Compared to traditional imaging omics, ultrasound-based DLR also needs some help, as it requires direct learning of features from data and a large dataset. Although there are more medical images than ever before, it is difficult to collect a large amount of data due to issues such as data privacy protection and complex artificial image annotation. In this comparative study, DLR can automatically extract deep features without relying on manual labeling by doctors, further improving its accuracy and reliability in tumor diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Ultrasound is the primary way of early diagnosis of breast cancer. Conclusion By analyzing the research status of ultrasound-based DLR in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast tumors, the prediction of molecular typing of breast cancer, the evaluation of axillary lymph node status, and the evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy in recent years, Ultrasound-based DLR directly extracts high-order features from datasets; although it is still in the development stage, it also demonstrates its superior performance, helping to reduce workload and improve diagnostic efficiency.},

Analyzing scRNA-seq data from 24 TNBC patients using integrated transcriptomics, machine-learning, and pseudo-time trajectory mapping, we developed a macrophage differentiation-based classifier (MMDCSS) (CD93, CHI3L1, ZBTB20) with remarkable prognostic accuracy (C-index: 0.929, 3-year AUC: 0.907). Computational pharmacology identified finasteride as a ZBTB20 modulator (binding energy:7.7 kcal/mol) capable of reversing tumor-induced M2 macrophage polarization. Finasteride significantly enhanced doxorubicin efficacy ex vivo and in vivo by reprogramming the TME, reducing M2 macrophage infiltration while promoting an M1 phenotype. Mechanistically, finasteride upregulated ZBTB20, counteracting TNBC-mediated suppression of this M1-associated transcription factor. Our findings establish ZBTB20 as a key regulator of macrophage polarization in TNBC and introduce finasteride as a clinically viable agent to reverse TME immunosuppression. Targeting macrophage polarization via ZBTB20 modulation, particularly by repurposing finasteride, offers a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC with immediate translational potential.},

  abstract={The accurate segmentation of breast tumors helps determine the boundaries and size of the tumor, providing crucial information for subsequent treatment planning. It also enables a more precise characterization of the tumor, which can be used to predict the patient's response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Existing methodologies predominantly rely on single-task learning, overlooking the potential inter-task correlations inherent in multi-task learning. Moreover, the available clinical knowledge derived from medical reports is often overlooked in prior research, which is important for enhancing the understanding of disease progression and treatment outcomes. To address these problems, we propose a knowledge integrated multi-task learning (KIMTL) network that performs tumor segmentation and pathological complete response (pCR) prediction concurrently. Clinical knowledge is merged with extracted high-level image features to enhance prediction performance. The attention mechanism effectively leverages the inter-channel and inter-spatial relationships within features, thereby enhancing network effectiveness. The proposed multi-task learning network optimizes the balance between segmentation and prediction tasks using uncertainty weight loss. The experimental results from a dataset of 216 cases indicate that KIMTL could improve the performance of both tasks, particularly the prediction task (AUC = 0.816). Specifically, in the prediction task, the AUC increases from 0.789 to 0.816. In the segmentation task, the Jaccard index is improved from 0.710 to 0.740. Our study suggests that incorporating clinical domain knowledge into deep learning modeling can augment the performance of breast tumor segmentation and pCR prediction. KIMTL achieves promising performance and outperforms its single-task learning counterparts.},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate a nomogram that combines contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) deep learning with clinical-pathological features to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response (either low Miller Payne (MP-L) grades 1–2 or high MP (MP-H) grades 3–5) in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 265 breast cancer patients were randomly allocated into training and test sets (used for models training and testing, respectively) at a 4:1 ratio. Deep learning models, based on the pre-trained ResNet34 model and initially fine-tuned for identifying breast cancer, were trained using low-energy and subtracted CESM images. The predicted results served as deep learning features for the deep learning-based model. Clinical-pathological features, including age, progesterone receptor (PR) status, estrogen receptor (ER) status, Ki67 expression levels, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, were used for the clinical model. All these features contributed to the nomogram. Feature selection was performed through univariate analysis. Logistic regression models were developed and chosen using a stepwise selection method. The deep learning-based and clinical models, along with the nomogram, were evaluated using precision–recall curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, specificity, recall, accuracy, negative predictive value, positive predictive value (PPV), balanced accuracy, F1-score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: The nomogram demonstrated considerable predictive ability, with higher area under the ROC curve (0.95, P < 0.05), accuracy (0.94), specificity (0.98), PPV (0.89), and precision (0.89) compared to the deep learning-based and clinical models. In DCA, the nomogram showed substantial clinical value in assisting breast cancer treatment decisions, exhibiting a higher net benefit than the other models. Conclusion: The nomogram, integrating CESM deep learning with clinical-pathological features, proved valuable for predicting NAC response in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Nomogram outperformed deep learning-based and clinical models.},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: This study aims to explore the feasibility of the deep learning radiomics nomogram (DLRN) for predicting tumor status and axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with breast cancer. Additionally, we employ a Cox regression model for survival analysis to validate the effectiveness of the fusion algorithm. Materials and Methods: A total of 243 patients who underwent NAC were retrospectively included between October 2014 and July 2022. The DLRN integrated clinical characteristics as well as radiomics and deep transfer learning features extracted from ultrasound (US) images. The diagnostic performance of DLRN was evaluated by constructing ROC curves, and the clinical usefulness of models was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA). A survival model was developed to validate the effectiveness of the fusion algorithm. Results: In the training cohort, the DLRN yielded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.984 and 0.985 for the tumor and LNM, while 0.892 and 0.870, respectively, in the test cohort. The consistency indices (C-index) of the nomogram were 0.761 and 0.731, respectively, in the training and test cohorts. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients in the high-risk group had significantly poorer overall survival than patients in the low-risk group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The US-based DLRN model could hold promise as clinical guidance for predicting the status of tumors and LNM after NAC in patients with breast cancer. This fusion model can also predict the prognosis of patients, which could help clinicians make better clinical decisions.},

  abstract={Purpose: To investigate if the pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)-based radiomics machine learning predicts the pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients. Methods: Seventy-eight breast cancer patients who underwent DCE-MRI before NAC and confirmed as pCR or non-pCR were enrolled. Early enhancement mapping images of pretreatment DCE-MRI were created using subtraction formula as follows: Early enhancement mapping = (Signal 1 min – Signal pre)/Signal pre. Images of the whole tumors were manually segmented and radiomics features extracted. Five prediction models were built using five scenarios that included clinical information, subjective radiological findings, first order texture features, second order texture features, and their combinations. In texture analysis workflow, the corresponding variables were identified by mutual information for feature selection and random forest was used for model prediction. In five models, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) to predict the pCR and several metrics for model evaluation were analyzed. Results: The best diagnostic performance based on F-score was achieved when both first and second order texture features with clinical information and subjective radiological findings were used (AUC = 0.77). The second best diagnostic performance was achieved with an AUC of 0.76 for first order texture features followed by an AUC of 0.76 for first and second order texture features. Conclusions: Pretreatment DCE-MRI can improve the prediction of pCR in breast cancer patients when all texture features with clinical information and subjective radiological findings are input to build the prediction model.},

  abstract={Objective: To construct a user-friendly nomogram with MRI and clinicopathological parameters for the prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in patients with breast cancer (BC). Methods: We retrospectively enrolled consecutive female patients pathologically confirmed with breast cancer who received NAT followed by surgery between January 2018 and December 2022 as the development cohort. Additionally, we prospectively collected eligible candidates between January 2023 and December 2023 as an external validation group at our institution. Pretreatment MRI features and clinicopathological variables were collected, and the pre- and post-treatment background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) and the changes in BPE on two MRIs were compared between patients who achieved pCR and those who did not. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent variables associated with pCR in the development cohort. These independent variables were combined into a predictive nomogram for which performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plot, decision curve analysis, and external validation. Results: In the development cohort, there were a total of 276 female patients with a mean age of 48.3 ± 8.7 years, while in the validation cohort, there were 87 female patients with a mean age of 49.0 ± 9.5 years. Independent prognostic factors of pCR included small tumor size, HER2(+), high Ki-67 index,high signal enhancement ratio (SER), low minimum value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin), and significantly decreased BPE after NAT(change of BPE). The nomogram, which incorporates the above parameters, demonstrated excellent predictive performance in both the development and external validation cohorts, with AUC values of 0.900 and 0.850, respectively. Additionally, the nomogram showed excellent calibration capacities, as indicated by Hosmer-Lemeshow test p values of 0.508 and 0.423 in the two cohorts. Furthermore, the nomogram provided greater net benefits compared to the default simple schemes in both cohorts. Conclusion: A nomogram constructed using tumor size, HER2 status, Ki-67 index, SER, ADCmin, and changes in pre- and post-NAT BPE demonstrated strong predictive performance, calibration ability, and greater net benefits for predicting pCR in patients with BC after NAT. This suggests that the user-friendly nomogram could be a valuable imaging biomarker for identifying suitable candidates for NAT.},

  abstract={Rationale and Objectives: To explore the association between pretherapeutic contrast-enhanced cone beam breast CT (CE-CBBCT) features and pathological complete response (pCR), and to develop a predictive model that integrates clinicopathological and imaging features. Methods: In this prospective study, a cohort of 200 female patients who underwent CE-CBBCT prior to neoadjuvant therapy and surgery was divided into train (n = 150) and test (n = 50) sets in a 3:1 ratio. Optimal predictive features were identified using univariate logistic regression and recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV). Models were constructed using XGBoost and evaluated through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. The performance of combined model was further evaluated across molecular subtypes. Feature significance within the combined model was determined using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) algorithm. Results: The model incorporating three clinicopathological and six CE-CBBCT imaging features demonstrated robust predictive performance for pCR, with area under curves (AUCs) of 0.924 in the train set and 0.870 in the test set. Molecular subtype, spiculation, and adjacent vascular sign (AVS) grade emerged as the most influential SHAP features. The highest AUCs were observed for HER2-positive subgroup (train: 0.935; test: 0.844), followed by luminal (train: 0.841; test: 0.717) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; train: 0.760; test: 0.583). SHAP analysis indicated that spiculation was crucial for luminal breast cancer prediction, while AVS grade was critical for HER2-positive and TNBC cases. Conclusion: Integrating clinicopathological and CE-CBBCT imaging features enhanced pCR prediction accuracy, particularly in HER2-positive cases, underscoring its potential clinical applicability.},

  abstract={Introduction: Predicting pathological complete response (pCR) for patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is crucial in establishing individualized treatment. Whole-slide images (WSIs) of tumor tissues reflect the histopathologic information of the tumor, which is important for therapeutic response effectiveness. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether predictive information for pCR could be detected from WSIs. Materials and methods: We retrospectively collected data from four cohorts of 874 patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven breast cancer. A deep learning pathological model (DLPM) was constructed to predict pCR using biopsy WSIs in the primary cohort, and it was then validated in three external cohorts. The DLPM could generate a deep learning pathological score (DLPs) for each patient; stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were selected for comparison with DLPs. Results: The WSI feature-based DLPM showed good predictive performance with the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 among the cohorts. Alternatively, the combination of the DLPM and clinical characteristics offered a better prediction performance (AUC >0.70) in all cohorts. We also evaluated the performance of DLPM in three different breast subtypes with the best prediction for the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype (AUC: 0.73). Moreover, DLPM combined with clinical characteristics and stromal TILs achieved the highest AUC in the primary cohort (AUC: 0.82) and validation cohort 1 (AUC: 0.80). Conclusion: Our study suggested that WSIs integrated with deep learning could potentially predict pCR to NAC in breast cancer. The predictive performance will be improved by combining clinical characteristics. DLPs from DLPM can provide more information compared to stromal TILs for pCR prediction.},

  abstract={Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subcategory of breast cancer with poor prognosis and high risk of recurrence after treatment. In a subset of cases systemic chemotherapy is offered before surgery, so called neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), to downstage the disease resulting in 40–50% of cases to a pathological complete response. Meanwhile, patients receiving NAC suffer from toxic side effects and in a proportion of patients a significant amount of residual tumor remains. This study aims to predict the outcome of NAC with deep learning technology based on the microscopic morphological characteristics in whole slide images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides from the pre-operative tumor biopsy before chemotherapy. Methods: A convolutional neural network was trained on 221 H&E-stained biopsies of carcinoma of no special type from 205 patients scanned at 40×. Cases were divided in three cohorts, with a good, moderate, or bad response to NAC based on the EUSOMA scoring according to the pathology report of the subsequent tumor surgery specimen. We defined good, moderate, and bad response as residual tumor <10%, 10–50%, and >50%, respectively. Manual segmentation of the tumor area was performed comprising invasive carcinoma with a small rim of surrounding benign tissue. The model was tested on 52 new biopsies of 50 patients. Because of the relative low number of moderate and bad responder cases, and to achieve a better discrimination for potential visual biomarkers, the moderate and bad response cohorts were merged. Results: The predictive performance of the model was calculated by means of the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC ROC). 95% Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for better understanding of the range of values. In the test set, the AUC ROC performance score was 0.696 with a CI of 0.532–0.861. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study shows that H&E pre-operative biopsies from TNBC, by means of deep learning technology, contain valuable information having predictive value for the outcome of NAC resulting in an AUC value of 0.696 outperforming a predictive AUC value of 0.63 based on structured clinical data of histological tumor grade, TILs, and ki-67 known from the literature.},

  abstract={Objective This systematic review aims to explore the role of MRI-based radiomics combined with machine learning (ML) algorithms in accurately diagnosing and classifying breast cancer subtypes. It emphasizes the performance of advanced ML models, especially deep learning (DL), in comparison with traditional methods like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests. The study focuses on how these models improve diagnostic accuracy for subtypes such as Luminal A/B, HER2-enriched, and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Methods A comprehensive search was conducted on October 11, 2024, using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science with the keywords “MRI AND Radiomics AND breast cancer.” Only peer-reviewed articles in English were included. Citation tracking via PubMed and Google Scholar ensured complete coverage. Studies involving breast cancer patients, using MRI radiomics (e.g., DCE-MRI, DWI) for subtype classification, and applying supervised ML models were selected. Data from 42 eligible studies were extracted, including radiomic features (texture, shape) and performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, AUC). Statistical analysis was conducted with Python libraries, focusing on pooled performance metrics and model generalizability. Results The review reveals that DL models perform better than traditional ML approaches, particularly in identifying aggressive subtypes like TNBC, achieving an AUC of 0.93 compared to 0.85 for SVM. Texture features emerged as the most significant predictors, contributing 40% to the overall accuracy of the models. Across all subtypes, DL consistently outperformed traditional methods, showing higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Using multiple MRI sequences further enhanced model performance. Conclusion This review demonstrates that combining MRI-based radiomics with ML can greatly enhance non-invasive breast cancer diagnosis. DL models, with their ability to capture complex tumor characteristics, offer the most potential for clinical use. However, challenges such as the need for standardized MRI protocols and the limited interpretability of some models must be addressed before these tools can be widely adopted. Future research should focus on large, multicenter studies and the integration of radiomic, genomic, and clinical data to develop more comprehensive precision oncology solutions.},

  abstract={Background: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a crucial determinant of breast cancer prognosis and treatment options. The study aimed to establish an MRI-based habitat model to quantify intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and evaluate its potential in predicting HER2 expression status. Methods: Data from 340 patients with pathologically confirmed invasive breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed. Two tasks were designed for this study: Task 1 distinguished between HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. Task 2 distinguished between HER2-low and HER2-zero breast cancer. We developed the ITH, deep learning (DL), and radiomics signatures based on the features extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Clinical independent predictors were determined by multivariable logistic regression. Finally, a combined model was constructed by integrating the clinical independent predictors, ITH signature, and DL signature. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) served as the standard for assessing the performance of models. Results: In task 1, the ITH signature performed well in the training set (AUC = 0.855) and the validation set (AUC = 0.842). In task 2, the AUCs of the ITH signature were 0.844 and 0.840, respectively, which still showed good prediction performance. In the validation sets of both tasks, the combined model exhibited the best prediction performance, with AUCs of 0.912 and 0.917 respectively, making it the optimal model. Conclusion: A combined model integrating clinical independent predictors, ITH signature, and DL signature can predict HER2 expression status preoperatively and noninvasively.},

  abstract={Objective: Timely diagnosis of breast cancer can ameliorate the treatment plan, thus reducing the mortality rate. We propose a model integrating pre-trained Convolutional neural network (CNN) with machine learning for prognosticating pathologic complete response(PCR) using breast cancer dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) prior to commencement of neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NACT). For predicting pathologic complete response (PCR) using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for breast cancer prior to the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we present a hybrid model integrating a pre-trained Convolutional neural network (CNN) with machine learning (NACT). Material & Methods: In this retrospective study, 64 patients receiving NACT for invasive breast cancer are examined. Deep learning-based pre-trained CNN models ResNet-50 and ResNet-18 were used to extract features from patient visit 1 MRI images (before the initiation of NACT). Mann-Whitney U tests is used to assess features and their relevance (significance level p less than 0.05 and confidence interval is 95 %). Furthermore, features extracted and features selected were independently given as an input to different machine learning classifiers for the prediction of response of NACT. Classification performance was assessed under different data division protocols using accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Result: The hybrid combination using ResNet-18 as feature extractor, fine K-nearest neighbor(KNN) as classifier and feature selected using Mann-Whitney U test outperformed the result. Accuracy of 99.8% and AUROC of 1 is obtained under hold-out validation protocol while accuracy of 99.3%, and AUROC of 0.99 is obtained under 10-fold cross-validation. Conclusion: The proposed model employing DCE-MRI images acquired before starting chemotherapy has considerable accuracy in classifying PCR and non-PCR patients. The efficacy of the prediction model can improve considerably on the back of a larger dataset.},

  abstract={Background: Pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is a critical prognostic marker for patients with breast cancer, potentially allowing surgery omission. However, noninvasive and accurate pCR diagnosis remains a significant challenge due to the limitations of current imaging techniques, particularly in cases where tumors completely disappear post-NACT. Methods: We developed a novel framework incorporating Dimensional Accumulation for Layered Images (DALI) and an Attention-Box annotation tool to address the unique challenge of analyzing imaging data where target lesions are absent. These methods transform three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging into two-dimensional representations and ensure consistent target tracking across time-points. Preprocessing techniques, including tissue-region normalization and subtraction imaging, were used to enhance model performance. Imaging features were extracted using radiomics and pretrained deep-learning models, and machine-learning algorithms were integrated into a stacked ensemble model. The approach was developed using the I-SPY 2 dataset and validated with an independent Tangshan People's Hospital cohort. Results: The stacked ensemble model achieved superior diagnostic performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.831 (95 % confidence interval, 0.769–0.887) on the test set, outperforming individual models. Tissue-region normalization and subtraction imaging significantly enhanced diagnostic accuracy. SHAP analysis identified variables that contributed to the model predictions, ensuring model interpretability. Conclusion: This innovative framework addresses challenges of noninvasive pCR diagnosis. Integrating advanced preprocessing techniques improves feature quality and model performance, supporting clinicians in identifying patients who can safely omit surgery. This innovation reduces unnecessary treatments and improves quality of life for patients with breast cancer.},

Results: We constructed a combined model, named SRADL, which includes deep learning with sub-regional radiomics signatures, enabling precise prediction of pCR in LARC patients. SRADL had satisfactory performance for the prediction of pCR in the training cohort (AUC 0.925 [95% CI 0.894 to 0.948]), and in test 1 (AUC 0.915 [95% CI 0.869 to 0.949]) and in test 2 (AUC 0.902 [95% CI 0.846 to 0.945]). By employing optimal threshold of 0.486, the predicted pCR group had longer survival compared to predicted non-pCR group across three cohorts. SRADL also outperformed other single-modality prediction models. Conclusion: The novel SRADL, which integrates deep learning with sub-regional signatures, showed high accuracy and robustness in predicting pCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy using pretreatment MRI images, making it a promising tool for the personalized management of LARC.},

  abstract={AIM: To develop and validate a combined model based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and whole-slide imaging (WSI) to predict pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 331 patients from two institutions, who pathologically confirmed to have invasive breast cancer and underwent NAC. Radiological features from original lesions on MRI and clinicopathological data were analysed using univariate and multivariate logistic analyses, which established the clinical model. Radiomics features were extracted based on the region of interest by manually delineating the primary focus on the sequences of the first phase of enhanced MRI, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping. The radiomics prediction model was established using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis. A deep learning pathological model (DLPM) was established from WSIs of patients used AlexNet. The combined model was developed based on clinicopathological features, radiomics features, and pathomics deep learning features, and presented as a nomogram. RESULTS: Five clinical and three deep learning features were screened and combined with the Rad-score to establish a combined model. The results showed that the nomogram had good predictive efficiency, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.95, 0.84, and 0.83 in the training, test, and external validation cohorts, respectively. The DeLong's test showed that the difference in AUC values between the combined model and the other single models was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A combined nomogram based on MRI and biopsy WSI can predict pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer.},

  abstract={Breast cancer is a significant global health burden, with increasing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early screening and accurate diagnosis are crucial for improving prognosis. Radiographic imaging modalities such as digital mammography (DM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and nuclear medicine techniques, are commonly used for breast cancer assessment. And histopathology (HP) serves as the gold standard for confirming malignancy. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies show great potential for quantitative representation of medical images to effectively assist in segmentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of breast cancer. In this review, we overview the recent advancements of AI technologies for breast cancer, including 1) improving image quality by data augmentation, 2) fast detection and segmentation of breast lesions and diagnosis of malignancy, 3) biological characterization of the cancer such as staging and subtyping by AI-based classification technologies, 4) prediction of clinical outcomes such as metastasis, treatment response, and survival by integrating multi-omics data. Then, we then summarize large-scale databases available to help train robust, generalizable, and reproducible deep learning models. Furthermore, we conclude the challenges faced by AI in real-world applications, including data curating, model interpretability, and practice regulations. Besides, we expect that clinical implementation of AI will provide important guidance for the patient-tailored management.},

  abstract={Purpose Pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is commonly accepted as the gold standard to assess outcome after NAC in breast cancer patients. F-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has unique value in tumor staging, predicting prognosis, and evaluating treatment response. Our aim was to determine if we could identify radiomic predictors from PET/CT in breast cancer patient therapeutic efficacy prior to NAC. Methods This retrospective study included 100 breast cancer patients who received NAC; there were 2210 PET/CT radiomic features extracted. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning models were used to identify the prognostic radiomic predictors through the following: (1) selection of the significant (p < 0.05) imaging features from consensus clustering and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test; (2) selection of the most discriminative features via univariate random forest (Uni-RF) and the Pearson correlation matrix (PCM); and (3) determination of the most predictive features from a traversal feature selection (TFS) based on a multivariate random forest (RF). The prediction model was constructed with RF and then validated with 10-fold cross-validation for 30 times and then independently validated. The performance of the radiomic predictors was measured in terms of area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Results The PET/CT radiomic predictors achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.857 (AUC = 0.844) on the training split set and 0.767 (AUC = 0.722) on the independent validation set. When age was incorporated, the accuracy for the split set increased to 0.857 (AUC = 0.958) and 0.8 (AUC = 0.73) for the independent validation set and both outperformed the clinical prediction model. We also found a close association between the radiomic features, receptor expression, and tumor T stage. Conclusion Radiomic predictors from pre-treatment PET/CT scans when combined with patient age were able to predict pCR after NAC. We suggest that these data will be valuable for patient management.},

This study aimed to evaluate the tumor shrinkage pattern and response to NACT by preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), diffuse weighted imaging (DWI) and T2 weighted imaging (T2WI). MethodIn this retrospective analysis, female patients with unilateral unifocal primary breast cancer were included for predicting tumor pathologic/clinical response to NACT (n=216, development set, n=151 and validation set, n=65) and for discriminating the tumor concentric shrinkage (CS) pattern from the others (n=193; development set, n=135 and validation set, n=58). Radiomic features (n=102) of first-order statistical, morphological and textural features were calculated on tumors from the multiparametric MRI. Single- and multiparametric image-based features were assessed separately and were further combined to feed into a random forest-based predictive model. The predictive model was trained in the testing set and assessed on the testing dataset with an area under the curve (AUC). Molecular subtype information and radiomic features were fused to enhance the predictive performance. ResultsThe DCE-MRI-based model showed higher performance (AUCs of 0.919, 0.830 and 0.825 for tumor pathologic response, clinical response and tumor shrinkage patterns, respectively) than either the T2WI or the ADC image-based model. An increased prediction performance was achieved by a model with multiparametric MRI radiomic feature fusion. ConclusionsAll these results demonstrated that multiparametric MRI features and their information fusion could be of important clinical value for the preoperative prediction of treatment response and shrinkage pattern.},

  abstract={BackgroundThe immunohistochemical test (IHC) of HER2 and HR can provide prognostic information and treatment guidance for invasive breast cancer patients. We aimed to develop noninvasive image signatures ISHER2 and ISHR of HER2 and HR, respectively. We independently evaluate their repeatability, reproducibility, and association with pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.MethodsPre-treatment DWI, IHC receptor status HER2/HR, and pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of 222 patients from the multi-institutional ACRIN 6698 trial were retrospectively collected. They were pre-separated for development, independent validation, and test-retest. 1316 image features were extracted from DWI-derived ADC maps within manual tumor segmentations. ISHER2 and ISHR were developed by RIDGE logistic regression using non-redundant and test-retest reproducible features relevant to IHC receptor status. We evaluated their association with pCR using area under receiver operating curve (AUC) and odds ratio (OR) after binarization. Their reproducibility was further evaluated using the test-retest set with intra-class coefficient of correlation (ICC).ResultsA 5-feature ISHER2 targeting HER2 was developed (AUC = 0.70, 95\% CI 0.59 to 0.82) and validated (AUC = 0.72, 95\% CI 0.58 to 0.86) with high perturbation repeatability (ICC = 0.92) and test-retest reproducibility (ICC = 0.83). ISHR was developed using 5 features with higher association with HR during development (AUC = 0.75, 95\% CI 0.66 to 0.84) and validation (AUC = 0.74, 95\% CI 0.61 to 0.86) and similar repeatability (ICC = 0.91) and reproducibility (ICC = 0.82). Both image signatures showed significant associations with pCR with AUC of 0.65 (95\% CI 0.50 to 0.80) for ISHER2 and 0.64 (95\% CI 0.50 to 0.78) for ISHER2 in the validation cohort. Patients with high ISHER2 were more likely to achieve pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with validation OR of 4.73 (95\% CI 1.64 to 13.65, P value = 0.006). Low ISHR patients had higher pCR with OR = 0.29 (95\% CI 0.10 to 0.81, P value = 0.021). Molecular subtypes derived from the image signatures showed comparable pCR prediction values to IHC-based molecular subtypes (P value > 0.05).ConclusionRobust ADC-based image signatures were developed and validated for noninvasive evaluation of IHC receptors HER2 and HR. We also confirmed their value in predicting treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Further evaluations in treatment guidance are warranted to fully validate their potential as IHC surrogates.},

  abstract={In recent years, tremendous success has been witnessed in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), widely used to various applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, energy systems, and biomedicine. HER2-positive breast cancer is a biologically distinct subtype characterized by the overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) which is one of the primary breast cancer cases, and there are many GNN-based models have offered transformative capabilities in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response prediction for HER2-positive breast cancer. However, most existing methods often rely on fixed graph structures that may not fully represent complex interactions among patients based on their baseline characteristics, and their resulting node/graph embedding quality is heavily dependent on labeled data. To address this, we propose Double-View Graph Contrastive Learning (DOVE-GCL), a novel graph contrastive learning framework leveraging two different patient-patient similarity graphs for the pathological complete response classification task. Moreover, we develop an innovative patient-patient similarity graph using a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM)-based system to capture domain specific knowledge about patients. We evaluate DOVE-GCL on a real-world dataset, with the model showing competitive performance. Our work, therefore, marks a significant step in HER2-positive breast cancer patient analysis within the realms of graph deep learning and LLMs.CCS Concepts• Applied computing;},

  abstract={A precise computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is introduced to predict two different tumor responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) by studying the correlation between radiological and clinical markers, and treatment response: complete response and stable disease. Predicting the NAC response assists physicians in managing the treatment plan effectively and reduces unnecessary use of NAC. First, the breast tumor is delineated from MRI modalities. Then, the proposed system extracts functional features, including the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 2nd-order texture features, such as gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM), from various MRI modalities. Afterward, statistical features are extracted from these matrices. Moreover, ADC features are represented statistically using percentiles with 2% intervals. Subsequently, a feature selection approach, namely the genetic algorithm (GA), is employed for each fused features individually (i.e., ADC, GLCM, and GLRLM) to extract the most relevant features. The resulting feature set undergoes a multi-stage feature generation system, introducing new features (i.e., probabilities), which are fused with its input and clinical markers and are then fed into a lightGBM classifier for final prediction. Our system was evaluated on 54 patients using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation, achieving a sensitivity of 89.89%, a specificity of 89.29%, and an accuracy of 89.09%, emphasizing the promise of our system in predicting breast tumor response to NAC.},

  abstract={Deep learning models based on medical images have made significant strides in predicting treatment outcomes. However, previous methods have primarily concentrated on single time-point images, neglecting the temporal dynamics and changes inherent in longitudinal medical images. Thus, we propose a Transformer-based longitudinal image analysis framework (LOMIA-T) to contrast and fuse latent representations from pre- and post-treatment medical images for predicting treatment response. Specifically, we first design a treatment response-based contrastive loss to enhance latent representation by discerning evolutionary processes across various disease stages. Then, we integrate latent representations from pre- and post-treatment CT images using a cross-attention mechanism. Considering the redundancy in the dual-branch output features induced by the cross-attention mechanism, we propose a clinically interpretable feature fusion strategy to predict treatment response. Experimentally, the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art longitudinal image analysis methods on an in-house Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) dataset, encompassing 170 pre- and post-treatment contrast-enhanced CT image pairs from ESCC patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Ablation experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed treatment response-based contrastive loss and feature fusion strategy.

  abstract={Accurate identification of patients who achieve pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is critical before surgery for guiding customized treatment regimens and assessing prognosis in breast cancer. However, current methods for predicting pCR primarily rely on single modality data or single time-point images, which fail to capture tumor changes and comprehensively represent tumor heterogeneity at both macro and micro levels. Additionally, complementary information between modalities is not fully interacted. In this paper, we present M2Fusion, pioneering the fusion of multi-time multimodal data for treatment response prediction, with two key components: the multi-time magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) contrastive learning loss that learns representations reflecting NAC-induced tumor changes; the orthogonal multimodal fusion module that integrates orthogonal information from MRIs and whole slide images (WSIs). To evaluate the proposed M2Fusion, we collect pre-treatment MRI, post-treatment MRI, and WSIs of biopsy from patients with breast cancer at two different collaborating hospitals, each with the pCR assessed by the standard pathological procedure. Experimental results quantitatively reveal that the proposed M2Fusion improves treatment response prediction and outperforms other multimodal fusion methods and single-modality approaches. Validation on external test sets further demonstrates the generalization and validity of the model. Our code is available at https://github.com/SongZHS/M2Fusion.},

Assessing and accurately predicting pathological complete response is important in treatment planing for breast cancer patients. In this study, we propose a novel approach integrating 3D MRI imaging data, molecular data and demographic data using convolutional neural network to predict the likelihood of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. We take post-contrast T1-weighted 3D MRI images without the need of tumor segmentation, and incorporate molecular subtypes and demographic data. In our predictive model, MRI data and non-imaging data are convolved to inform each other through interactions, instead of a concatenation of multiple data type channels. This is achieved by channel-wise multiplication of the intermediate results of imaging and non-imaging data. We use a subset of curated data from the I-SPY-1 TRIAL of 112 patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer with breast tumors underwent standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our method yielded an accuracy of 0.83, AUC of 0.80, sensitivity of 0.68 and specificity of 0.88. Our model significantly outperforms models using imaging data only or traditional concatenation models. Our approach has the potential to aid physicians to identify patients who are likely to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy at diagnosis or early treatment, thus facilitate treatment planning, treatment execution, or mid-treatment adjustment.},

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective technique implementing persistent homology to extract multi-dimensional topological representations from 3D data, making the computation much faster. To incorporate the extracted topological information, we then propose a novel approach to distill the extracted topological knowledge into deep neural networks with response-based knowledge distillation. Our experimental results quantitatively show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance by increasing the accuracy from previously 85.1% to 90.5% in the pCR prediction and reducing the topological computation time by about 66% on a public dataset for breast DCE-MRI images.},
