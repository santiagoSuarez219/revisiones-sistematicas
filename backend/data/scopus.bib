	abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to develop a comprehensive nomogram model by integrating clinical pathological and full-field digital mammography (FFDM) radiomic features to predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients, thereby providing personalized treatment recommendations. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical and imaging data of 227 breast cancer patients from 2016 to 2024 at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University. The patients were divided into a training set (n = 159) and a test set (n = 68) with a 7:3 ratio. The region of interest (ROI) was manually segmented on FFDM images, and features were extracted and gradually selected. The rad-score was calculated for each patient. Five machine learning classifiers were used to build radiomics models, and the optimal model was selected. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for predicting the efficacy of NAC in breast cancer patients. A nomogram prediction model was further developed by combining the independent risk factors and rad-score, and probability-based stratification was applied. An independent cohort was collected from an external hospital to evaluate the performance of the model. Results: The radiomics model based on support vector machine (SVM) demonstrated the best predictive performance. FFDM tumor density and HER-2 status were identified as independent risk factors for achieving pathologic complete response (PCR) after NAC (p < 0.05). The nomogram prediction model, developed by combining the independent risk factors and rad-score, outperformed other models, with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 and 0.85 for the training and test sets, respectively. Based on the optimal cutoff points of 103.42 from the nomogram model, patients were classified into high-probability and low-probability groups. When the nomogram model was applied to an independent cohort of 47 patients, only four patients had incorrect diagnoses. The nomogram model demonstrated stable and accurate predictive performance. Conclusion: The nomogram prediction model, developed by integrating clinical pathological and radiomic features, demonstrated significant performance in predicting the efficacy of NAC in breast cancer, providing valuable reference for clinical personalized prediction planning.

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the association between pretreatment MRI descriptors and breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials and methods: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Results: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n = 7/37, 19%), triple negative (n = 30/55, 55%), HER2 + (n = 22/37, 59%)). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p < 0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p = 0.008), higher Ki67 (p = 0.005), and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p = 0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p = 0.047), unifocality (p = 0.026), non-spiculated margins (p = 0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (p = 0.024), and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031), were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67), and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. Clinical relevance statement: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes. Key Points: • Unifocality and non-spiculated margins are independently associated with pCR at multivariable logistic regression analysis. • Breast edema score is associated with MR tumor size and TIL expression, not only in TN BC as previously reported, but also in luminal BC. • Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in machine learning classifiers significantly increased sensitivity, specificity, and precision for pCR prediction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.},

	abstract = {Background: While the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is generally accepted, not all patients derive benefit from this preoperative treatment. Presently, there are no validated biomarkers to predict the NACT response, and previous attempts to develop predictive classifiers based on gene expression data have not demonstrated clinical utility. However, predictive models incorporating biological constraints have shown increased robustness and improved performance compared to agnostic classifiers. Methods: We used the preoperative transcriptomic profiles from 298 patients with TNBC to train and test a rank-based classifier, k-top scoring pairs, to predict whether the patient will have pathological complete response (pCR) or residual disease (RD) following NACT. To reduce overfitting and enhance the signature’s interpretability, we constrained the training process to genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway. Subsequently, we evaluated the signature performance on two independent cohorts with 75 and 71 patients. Finally, we assessed the prognostic value of the signature by examining its association with relapse-free survival (RFS) using Kaplan‒Meier (KM) survival estimates and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The final signature consists of five gene pairs, whose relative ordering can be predictive of the NACT response. The signature has a robust performance at predicting pCR in TNBC patients with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.76 and 0.85 in the first and second testing cohorts, respectively, outperforming other gene signatures developed for the same purpose. Additionally, the signature was significantly associated with RFS in an independent TNBC patient cohort even after adjusting for T stage, patient age at the time of diagnosis, type of breast surgery, and menopausal status. Conclusion: We introduce a robust gene signature to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with TNBC. This signature applies easily interpretable, rank-based decision rules to genes regulated by the Notch signaling pathway, a known determinant in breast cancer chemoresistance. The robust predictive and prognostic performance of the signature make it a strong candidate for clinical implementation, aiding in the stratification of TNBC patients undergoing NACT. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: The early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) will aid in the development of personalized treatments for patients with breast cancer. This study investigated the value of longitudinal multimodal deep learning (DL) based on breast MR and ultrasound (US) in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after NAC. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the pre-NAC and post-2nd-NAC MR and/or US images of 448 patients enrolled from three centers and extracted DL features from the largest section of the breast tumour using ResNet50. T test, Pearson correlation analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used to select the most significant DL features for the pre-NAC and post-2nd-NAC MR and US DL models. The stacking model integrates different single-modality DL models and meaningful clinical data. The diagnostic performance of the models was evaluated. Results: In all the patients, the pCR rate was 36.65%. There was no significant difference in diagnostic performance between the different single-modality DL models (DeLong test, p > 0.05). The stacking model integrating the above four DL models with HER2 status yielded areas under the curves of 0.951-0.979, accuracies of 91.55%–92.65%, sensitivities of 90.63%–93.94%, and specificities of 89.47%–94.44% in the cohorts. Conclusion: Longitudinal multimodal DL can be useful in predicting pCR. The stacking model can be used as a new tool for the early noninvasive prediction of the response to NAC, as evidenced by its excellent performance, and therefore aid the development of personalized treatment strategies for patients with breast cancer. © 2025 The Association of University Radiologists},

	abstract = {Aim: To investigate whether methodological aspects may influence the performance of MRI-radiomic models to predict response to neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) in breast cancer (BC) patients. Materials and methods: We conducted a systematic review until March 2023. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to combine the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s test and heterogeneity was estimated by I2. A meta-regression was conducted to investigate the impact of various factors, including scanner, features’ number/transformation/type, pixel/voxel scaling, etc. Results: Forty-two studies were included. The summary AUC was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.74–0.81). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 81%) with no publication bias (p = 0.35). Radiomic model accuracy was influenced by the scanner vendor, with lower AUCs in studies using mixed scanner vendors (AUC; 95% CI: 0.70; 0.61–0.78) compared to studies including images obtained from the same scanner (AUC (95% CI): 0.83 (0.77–0.88), 0.74 (0.67–0.82), 0.83 (0.78–0.89) for three different vendors; vendors 1, 2, and 3, respectively; p-value = 0.03 for comparison with vendor 1). Feature type also seemed to have an impact on the AUC, with higher prediction accuracy observed for studies using 3D than 2D/2.5D images (AUC; 95% CI: 0.81; 0.78–0.85 and 0.73; 0.65–0.81, respectively, p-value = 0.03). Non-significant between-study heterogeneity was observed in the studies including 3D images (I2 = 33%) and Vendor 1 scanners (I2 = 40%). Conclusion: MRI-radiomics has emerged as a potential method for predicting the response to NAT in BC patients, showing promising outcomes. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the diversity among the methodological choices applied. Further investigations should prioritize achieving standardized protocols, and enhancing methodological rigor in MRI-radiomics. Key Points: Question Do methodological aspects influence the performance of MRI-radiomic models in predicting response to NAT in BC patients? Findings Radiomic model accuracy was influenced by the scanner vendor and feature type. Clinical relevance Methodological discrepancies affect the performance of MRI-radiomic models. Developing standardized protocols and enhancing methodological rigor in these studies should be prioritized. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Early prediction of treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer can facilitate timely adjustment of treatment regimens. We aimed to develop and validate a Siamese multi-task network (SMTN) for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) based on longitudinal ultrasound images at the early stage of NACT. Methods: In this multicentre, retrospective cohort study, a total of 393 patients with biopsy-proven HER2-positive breast cancer were retrospectively enrolled from three hospitals in china between December 16, 2013 and March 05, 2021, and allocated into a training cohort and two external validation cohorts. Patients receiving full cycles of NACT and with surgical pathological results available were eligible for inclusion. The key exclusion criteria were missing ultrasound images and/or clinicopathological characteristics. The proposed SMTN consists of two subnetworks that could be joined at multiple layers, which allowed for the integration of multi-scale features and extraction of dynamic information from longitudinal ultrasound images before and after the first /second cycles of NACT. We constructed the clinical model as a baseline using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Then the performance of SMTN was evaluated and compared with the clinical model. Findings: The training cohort, comprising 215 patients, were selected from Yunnan Cancer Hospital. The two independent external validation cohorts, comprising 95 and 83 patients, were selected from Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, and Shanxi Cancer Hospital, respectively. The SMTN yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.986 (95% CI: 0.977–0.995), 0.902 (95%CI: 0.856–0.948), and 0.957 (95%CI: 0.924–0.990) in the training cohort and two external validation cohorts, respectively, which were significantly higher than that those of the clinical model (AUC: 0.524–0.588, Pall < 0.05). The AUCs values of the SMTN within the anti-HER2 therapy subgroups were 0.833-0.972 in the two external validation cohorts. Moreover, 272 of 279 (97.5%) non-pCR patients (159 of 160 (99.4%), 53 of 54 (98.1%), and 60 of 65 (92.3%) in the training and two external validation cohorts, respectively) were successfully identified by the SMTN, suggesting that they could benefit from regime adjustment at the early-stage of NACT. Interpretation: The SMTN was able to predict pCR in the early-stage of NACT for HER2-positive breast cancer patients, which could guide clinicians in adjusting treatment regimes.

	abstract = {Background: So far, baseline Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) has played a key role for the application of sophisticated artificial intelligence-based models using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract quantitative imaging information as earlier indicators of pathological Complete Response (pCR) achievement in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However, these models did not exploit the DCE-MRI exams in their full geometry as 3D volume but analysed only few individual slices independently, thus neglecting the depth information. Method: This study aimed to develop an explainable 3D CNN, which fulfilled the task of pCR prediction before the beginning of NAC, by leveraging the 3D information of post-contrast baseline breast DCE-MRI exams. Specifically, for each patient, the network took in input a 3D sequence containing the tumor region, which was previously automatically identified along the DCE-MRI exam. A visual explanation of the decision-making process of the network was also provided. Results: To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is competitive than other models in the field, which made use of imaging data alone, reaching a median AUC value of 81.8%, 95%CI [75.3%; 88.3%], a median accuracy value of 78.7%, 95%CI [74.8%; 82.5%], a median sensitivity value of 69.8%, 95%CI [59.6%; 79.9%] and a median specificity value of 83.3%, 95%CI [82.6%; 84.0%], respectively. The median and CIs were computed according to a 10-fold cross-validation scheme for 5 rounds. Conclusion: Finally, this proposal holds high potential to support clinicians on non-invasively early pursuing or changing patient-centric NAC pathways. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Objective: To establish and validate a radiomics nomogram based on contrast-enhanced (CE)-MRI for predicting the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer with non-mass enhancement (NME). Methods: A cohort comprising 117 HER2-positive breast cancer patients showing NME on CE-MRI between January 2012 and December 2019 were retrospectively analysed in our study. Patients were classified as pathological complete respone (pCR) according to surgical specimens and axillary lymph nodes without invasive tumour cells. Clinicopathological data were recorded, and images were assessed by two radiologists. A total of 1130 radiomics features were extracted from the primary tumour and six radiomics features were selected by the maximal relevance and minimal redundancy and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithms. Univariate logistic regression was used to screen mean-ingful clinical and imaging features. The rad-score and independent risk factors were incorporated to build a nomogram model. Calibration and receiver operator characteristic curves were used to confirm the performance of the nomogram in the training and testing cohorts. The clinical usefulness of the nomogram was evaluated by decision curve analysis. Results: The difference in the rad-score between the pCR and non-pCR groups was significant in the training and testing cohorts (p < 0.01). The nomogram model showed good calibration and discrimination, with AUCs of 0.900 and 0.810 in the training and testing cohorts. Decision curve analysis indicated that the radiomics-based model was superior in terms of patient clinical benefit. Conclusion: The MRI-based radiomics nomogram model could be used to pre-operatively predict the efficacy of NAC in HER2-positive breast cancer patients showing NME. Advances in knowledge: HER2-positive breast cancer showing segmental enhancement on CE-MRI was more likely to achieve pCR after NAC than regional enhancement and diffuse enhancement. The MRI-based radiomics nomogram model could be used to pre-operatively predict the efficacy of NAC in HER2-positive breast cancer that showed NME. © 2022, British Institute of Radiology.

	abstract = {Background: For patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), most of the existing prediction models of pathologic complete response (pCR) using clinicopathological features were based on standard statistical models like logistic regression, while models based on machine learning mostly utilized imaging data and/or gene expression data. This study aims to develop a robust and accessible machine learning model to predict pCR using clinicopathological features alone, which can be used to facilitate clinical decision-making in diverse settings. Methods: The model was developed and validated within the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB, 2018–2020) and an external cohort at the University of Chicago (2010–2020). We compared logistic regression and machine learning models, and examined whether incorporating quantitative clinicopathological features improved model performance. Decision curve analysis was conducted to assess the model’s clinical utility. Results: We identified 56,209 NCDB patients receiving NACT (pCR rate: 34.0%). The machine learning model incorporating quantitative clinicopathological features showed the best discrimination performance among all the fitted models [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.785, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.778–0.792], along with outstanding calibration performance. The model performed best among patients with hormone receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer (AUC: 0.817, 95% CI: 0.802–0.832); and by adopting a 7% prediction threshold, the model achieved 90.5% sensitivity and 48.8% specificity, with decision curve analysis finding a 23.1% net reduction in chemotherapy use. In the external testing set of 584 patients (pCR rate: 33.4%), the model maintained robust performance both overall (AUC: 0.711, 95% CI: 0.668–0.753) and in the HR+/HER2- subgroup (AUC: 0.810, 95% CI: 0.742–0.878). Conclusions: The study developed a machine learning model (https://huolab.cri.uchicago.edu/sample-apps/pcrmodel) to predict pCR in breast cancer patients undergoing NACT that demonstrated robust discrimination and calibration performance. The model performed particularly well among patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer, having the potential to identify patients who are less likely to achieve pCR and can consider alternative treatment strategies over chemotherapy. The model can also serve as a robust baseline model that can be integrated with smaller datasets containing additional granular features in future research. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: This study aimed to assess whether a combined model incorporating radiomic and depth features extracted from PET/CT can predict disease-free survival (DFS) in patients who failed to achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Results: This study retrospectively included one hundred and five non-pCR patients. After a median follow-up of 71 months, 15 and 7 patients experienced recurrence and death, respectively. The primary tumor volume underwent feature extraction, yielding a total of 3644 radiomic features and 4096 depth features. The modeling procedure employed Cox regression for feature selection and utilized Cox proportional-hazards models to make predictions on DFS. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were utilized to evaluate and compare the predictive performance of different models. 2 clinical features (RCB, cT), 4 radiomic features, and 7 depth features were significant predictors of DFS and were included to develop models. The integrated model incorporating RCB, cT, and radiomic and depth features extracted from PET/CT images exhibited the highest accuracy for predicting 5-year DFS in the training (AUC 0.943) and the validation cohort (AUC 0.938). Conclusion: The integrated model combining radiomic and depth features extracted from PET/CT images can accurately predict 5-year DFS in non-pCR patients. It can help identify patients with a high risk of recurrence and strengthen adjuvant therapy to improve survival. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the value of delta-radiomics after the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI for early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with breast cancer. Methods: From September 2018 to May 2021, a total of 140 consecutive patients (training, n = 98: validation, n = 42), newly diagnosed with breast cancer who received NAC before surgery, were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent DCE-MRI at pre-NAC (pre-) and after the first cycle (1st-) of NAC. Radiomic features were extracted from the postcontrast early, peak, and delay phases. Delta-radiomics features were computed in each contrast phases. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and a logistic regression model were used to select features and build models. The model performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and compared by DeLong test. Results: The delta-radiomics model based on the early phases of DCE-MRI showed a highest AUC (0.917/0.842 for training/validation cohort) compared with that using the peak and delay phases images. The delta-radiomics model outperformed the pre-radiomics model (AUC = 0.759/0.617, p = 0.011/0.047 for training/validation cohort) in early phase. Based on the optimal model, longitudinal fusion radiomic models achieved an AUC of 0.871/0.869 in training/validation cohort. Clinical-radiomics model generated good calibration and discrimination capacity with AUC 0.934 (95%CI: 0.882, 0.986)/0.864 (95%CI: 0.746, 0.982) for training and validation cohort.

	abstract = {Background: Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) regimens for breast cancer are generally determined according to cancer stage and molecular subtypes without fully considering the inter-patient variability, which may lead to inefficiency or overtreatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) may support personalized regimen recommendations by learning the synergistic relationship between pre-NAT individual-patient data, regimens, and corresponding short- or long-term therapy responses. Methods: In this retrospective study, we collected data from breast cancer patients treated with NAT between 2000 and 2020 from the Netherlands and the USA. Median follow-up times ranged from 3·7 to 4·9 years across molecular subtypes and cohorts. We developed and externally validated a multi-modal model integrating pre-NAT clinical data, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI images, and medical reports to predict pathological complete response (pCR) and likelihood of survival after NAT. We subsequently evaluated potential benefits for patients receiving a personalized regimen recommended based on these predictions. Findings: We trained our model on 655 patients and validated it on internal (655 patients) and external (241 patients) cohorts. Given the factual regimens, the model can correctly predict the corresponding therapy response, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0·80 (95% CI 0·73–0·87), 0·75 (0·66–0·83), and 0·85 (0·77–0·92) for pCR prediction of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+, triple-negative, and estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR)+&HER2− patients in the internal validation cohort, respectively. Performance in the external validation cohort was 0·707 (0·557–0·836), 0·558 (0·359–0·749), and 0·860 (0·767–0·945) for the corresponding molecular subtypes, respectively. In the internal validation cohort, survival prediction identified high-risk patients across different molecular subtypes, as demonstrated by a hazard ratio (HR) of 3·29 (0·91–11·94) (HER2+), 3·54 (1·52–8·20) (triple-negative), and 2·78 (1·45–5·31) (ER/PR+&HER2−), albeit results were not significant for HER2+ cancers. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that the prognostic scores generated by the response model could identify patient subgroups with relatively poor outcomes under their actual treatments. These preliminary findings may inform future efforts toward personalized NAT regimen selection beyond traditional criteria such as cancer stage and subtype, but should be interpreted cautiously and validated in prospective studies with longer follow-up because these tumors can relapse at a later stage.

	abstract = {Purpose: Noninvasive, accurate and novel approaches to predict patients who will achieve pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) could assist treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to explore the application of machine learning (ML) based peritumoral ultrasound radiomics signature (PURS), compared with intratumoral radiomics (IURS) and clinicopathologic factors, for early prediction of pCR. Methods: We analyzed 358 locally advanced breast cancer patients (250 in the training set and 108 in the test set), who accepted NAC and post NAC surgery at our institution. The clinical and pathological data were analyzed using the independent t test and the Chi-square test to determine the factors associated with pCR. The PURS and IURS of baseline breast tumors were extracted by using 3D-slicer and PyRadiomics software. Five ML classifiers including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) were applied to construct radiomics predictive models. The performance of PURS, IURS models and clinicopathologic predictors were assessed with respect to sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the areas under the curve (AUCs). Results: Ninety-seven patients achieved pCR. The clinicopathologic predictors obtained an AUC of 0.759. Among PURS models, the RF classifier achieved better efficacy (AUC of 0.889) than LR (0.849), AdaBoost (0.823), SVM (0.746) and LDA (0.732). The RF classifier also obtained a maximum AUC of 0.931 than 0.920 (AdaBoost), 0.875 (LR), 0.825 (SVM), and 0.798 (LDA) in IURS models in the test set. The RF based PURS yielded higher predictive ability (AUC 0.889; 95% CI 0.814, 0.947) than clinicopathologic factors (AUC 0.759; 95% CI 0.657, 0.861; p < 0.05), but lower efficacy compared with IURS (AUC 0.931; 95% CI 0.865, 0.980; p < 0.05). Conclusion: The peritumoral US radiomics, as a novel potential biomarker, can assist clinical therapy decisions. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model to accurately predict the probability of achieving total pathological complete response (tpCR) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: This multi-center retrospective study included pre-NAC clinical pathology data from 698 LABC patients. Post-operative pathological outcomes divided patients into tpCR and non-tpCR groups. Data from 586 patients at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital were randomly assigned to a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). In comparison, data from our hospital's remaining 112 patients were used for external validation. Variable selection was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis. Predictive models were constructed using six ML algorithms: decision trees, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine, light gradient boosting machine, and extreme gradient boosting. Model efficacy was assessed through various metrics, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall (PR) curves, confusion matrices, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The best-performing model was selected by comparing the performance of different algorithms. Moreover, variable relevance was ranked using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique to improve the interpretability of the model and solve the "black box" problem. Results: A total of 191 patients (32.59%) achieved tpCR following NAC. Through LASSO regression analysis, five variables were identified as predictive factors for model construction, including tumor size, Ki-67, molecular subtype, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy regimen. The KNN model outperformed the other five classifier algorithms, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.847 (95% CI: 0.809-0.883) in the training set, 0.763 (95% CI: 0.670-0.856) in the test set, and 0.665 (95% CI: 0.555-0.776) in the external validation set. DCA demonstrated that the KNN model yielded the highest net advantage through a wide range of threshold probabilities in both the training and test sets. Furthermore, the analysis of the KNN model utilizing SHAP technology demonstrated that targeted therapy is the most crucial factor in predicting tpCR. Conclusion: An ML prediction model using clinical and pathological data collected before NAC was developed and verified. This model accurately predicted the probability of achieving a tpCR in patients with LABC after receiving NAC. SHAP technology enhanced the interpretability of the model and assisted in clinical decision-making and therapy optimization. © The author(s).},

	abstract = {Manual delineation of volumes of interest (VOIs) by experts is considered the gold-standard method in radiomics analysis. However, it suffers from inter- and intra-operator variability. A quantitative assessment of the impact of variations in these delineations on the performance of the radiomics predictors is required to develop robust radiomics based prediction models. In this study, we developed radiomics models for the prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with two different breast cancer subtypes based on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging acquired prior to treatment (baseline MRI scans). Different mathematical operations such as erosion, smoothing, dilation, randomization, and ellipse fitting were applied to the original VOIs delineated by experts to simulate variations of segmentation masks. The effects of such VOI modifications on various steps of the radiomics workflow, including feature extraction, feature selection, and prediction performance, were evaluated. Using manual tumor VOIs and radiomics features extracted from baseline MRI scans, an AUC of up to 0.96 and 0.89 was achieved for human epidermal growth receptor 2 positive and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively. For smoothing and erosion, VOIs yielded the highest number of robust features and the best prediction performance, while ellipse fitting and dilation lead to the lowest robustness and prediction performance for both breast cancer subtypes. At most 28% of the selected features were similar to manual VOIs when different VOI delineation data were used. Differences in VOI delineation affect different steps of radiomics analysis, and their quantification is therefore important for development of standardized radiomics research. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has demonstrated a strong correlation to improved survival in breast cancer (BC) patients. However, pCR rates to NAC are less than 30%, depending on the BC subtype. Early prediction of NAC response would facilitate therapeutic modifications for individual patients, potentially improving overall treatment outcomes and patient survival. Purpose: This study, for the first time, proposes a hierarchical self-attention-guided deep learning framework to predict NAC response in breast cancer patients using digital histopathological images of pre-treatment biopsy specimens. Methods: Digitized hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of BC core needle biopsies were obtained from 207 patients treated with NAC, followed by surgery. The response to NAC for each patient was determined using the standard clinical and pathological criteria after surgery. The digital pathology images were processed through the proposed hierarchical framework consisting of patch-level and tumor-level processing modules followed by a patient-level response prediction component. A combination of convolutional layers and transformer self-attention blocks were utilized in the patch-level processing architecture to generate optimized feature maps. The feature maps were analyzed through two vision transformer architectures adapted for the tumor-level processing and the patient-level response prediction components. The feature map sequences for these transformer architectures were defined based on the patch positions within the tumor beds and the bed positions within the biopsy slide, respectively. A five-fold cross-validation at the patient level was applied on the training set (144 patients with 9430 annotated tumor beds and 1,559,784 patches) to train the models and optimize the hyperparameters. An unseen independent test set (63 patients with 3574 annotated tumor beds and 173,637 patches) was used to evaluate the framework. Results: The obtained results on the test set showed an AUC of 0.89 and an F1-score of 90% for predicting pCR to NAC a priori by the proposed hierarchical framework. Similar frameworks with the patch-level, patch-level + tumor-level, and patch-level + patient-level processing components resulted in AUCs of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.84 and F1-scores of 86%, 87%, and 89%, respectively. Conclusions: The results demonstrate a high potential of the proposed hierarchical deep-learning methodology for analyzing digital pathology images of pre-treatment tumor biopsies to predict the pathological response of breast cancer to NAC. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: To reduce breast tumor size before surgery, Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC) is applied systematically to patients with local breast cancer. However, with the existing clinical protocols, it is not yet possible to have an early prediction of the effect of chemotherapy on a breast tumor. Predicting the response to chemotherapy could reduce toxicity and delay effec-tive treatment. Computational analysis of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Images (DCE-MRI) through Deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has proved a significant performance in classifying responders and no responder’s patients. This study intends to present a new explainable Deep Learning (DL) model predicting the breast cancer response to chemotherapy based on multiple MRI inputs. Material and Methods: In this study, a cohort of 42 breast cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy was used to train and validate the proposed DL model. This dataset was provided by the Jules Bordet institute of radiology in Brussels, Belgium. 14 external subjects were used to validate the DL model to classify responding or non-responding patients on temporal DCE-MRI volumes. The model performance was assessed by the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), accuracy, and features map visualization according to pathological complete response (Ground truth). Results: The developed deep learning architecture was able to predict the responding breast tumors to chemotherapy treatment in the external validation dataset with an AUC of 0.93 using par-allel learning MRI images acquired at different moments. The visual results showed that the most important extracted features from non-responding tumors are in the peripheral and external tumor regions. The model proposed in this study is more efficient compared to those proposed in the literature. Conclusion: Even with a limited training dataset size, the developed multi-input CNN model using DCE-MR images acquired before and following the first chemotherapy was able to predict responding and non-responding tumors with higher accuracy. Thanks to the visualization of the extracted characteristics by the DL model on the responding and non-responding tumors, the latter could be used henceforth in clinical analysis after its evaluation based on more extra data. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Background: Optimizing patient selection for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer remains an unmet clinical need. Quantitative features from medical imaging were reported to be predictive of treatment responses. However, the biologic meaning of these latent features is poorly understood, preventing the clinical use of such noninvasive imaging markers. The study aimed to develop a deep learning signature (DLS) from pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer and to further investigate the biologic meaning of the DLS by identifying its underlying pathways using paired MRI and proteomic sequencing data. Methods: MRI-based DLS was constructed (radiogenomic training dataset, n = 105) and validated (radiogenomic validation dataset, n = 26) for the prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Proteomic sequencing revealed biological functions facilitating pCR (n = 139). Their associations with DLS were uncovered by radiogenomic analysis. Results: The DLS achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.923 with an AUC of 0.958, higher than the performance of the model trained by transfer learning. Cellular membrane formation, endocytosis, insulin-like growth factor binding, protein localization to membranes, and cytoskeleton-dependent trafficking were differentially regulated in patients showing pCR. Oncogenic signaling pathways, features correlated with human phenotypes, and features correlated with general biological processes were significantly correlated with DLS in both training and validation dataset (p.adj < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study offers a biologically interpretable DLS for the prediction of pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer, which may guide personalized medication. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: The pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) of breast cancer is closely related to a better prognosis. However, there are no reliable indicators to accurately identify which patients will achieve pCR before surgery, and a model for predicting pCR to NAC is required. Methods: A total of 269 breast cancer patients in Shandong Cancer Hospital and Liaocheng People’s Hospital receiving anthracycline and taxane-based NAC were prospectively enrolled. Expression profiling using a 457 cancer-related gene sequencing panel (DNA sequencing) covering genes recurrently mutated in breast cancer was carried out on 243 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies samples before NAC from 243 patients. The unique personalized panel of nine individual somatic mutation genes from the constructed model was used to detect and analyze ctDNA on 216 blood samples. Blood samples were collected at indicated time points including before chemotherapy initiation, after the 1st NAC and before the 2nd NAC cycle, during intermediate evaluation, and prior to surgery. In this study, we characterized the value of gene profile mutation and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in combination with clinical characteristics in the prediction of pCR before surgery and investigated the prognostic prediction. The median follow-up time for survival analysis was 898 days. Results: Firstly, we constructed a predictive NAC response model including five single nucleotide variant (SNV) mutations (TP53, SETBP1, PIK3CA, NOTCH4 and MSH2) and four copy number variation (CNV) mutations (FOXP1-gain, EGFR-gain, IL7R-gain, and NFKB1A-gain) in the breast tumor, combined with three clinical factors (luminal A, Her2 and Ki67 status). The tumor prediction model showed good discrimination of chemotherapy sensitivity for pCR and non-pCR with an AUC of 0.871 (95% CI, 0.797–0.927) in the training set, 0.771 (95% CI, 0.649–0.883) in the test set, and 0.726 (95% CI, 0.556–0.865) in an extra test set. This tumor prediction model can also effectively predict the prognosis of disease-free survival (DFS) with an AUC of 0.749 at 1 year and 0.830 at 3 years. We further screened the genes from the tumor prediction model to establish a unique personalized panel consisting of 9 individual somatic mutation genes to detect and analyze ctDNA. It was found that ctDNA positivity decreased with the passage of time during NAC, and ctDNA status can predict NAC response and metastasis recurrence. Finally, we constructed the chemotherapy prediction model combined with the tumor prediction model and pretreatment ctDNA levels, which has a better prediction effect of pCR with the AUC value of 0.961. Conclusions: In this study, we established a chemotherapy predictive model with a non-invasive tool that is built based on genomic features, ctDNA status, as well as clinical characteristics for predicting pCR to recognize the responders and non-responders to NAC, and also predicting prognosis for DFS in breast cancer. Adding pretreatment ctDNA levels to a model containing gene profile mutation and clinical characteristics significantly improves stratification over the clinical variables alone. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {There is a need to identify biomarkers predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We previously obtained evidence that a polyamine signature in the blood is associated with TNBC development and progression. In this study, we evaluated whether plasma polyamines and other metabolites may identify TNBC patients who are less likely to respond to NACT. Pre-treatment plasma levels of acetylated polyamines were elevated in TNBC patients that had moderate to extensive tumor burden (RCB-II/III) following NACT compared to those that achieved a complete pathological response (pCR/RCB-0) or had minimal residual disease (RCB-I). We further applied artificial intelligence to comprehensive metabolic profiles to identify additional metabolites associated with treatment response. Using a deep learning model (DLM), a metabolite panel consisting of two polyamines as well as nine additional metabolites was developed for improved prediction of RCB-II/III. The DLM has potential clinical value for identifying TNBC patients who are unlikely to respond to NACT and who may benefit from other treatment modalities.

	abstract = {Background: The accurate and early evaluation of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and minimizing unnecessary interventions. While deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise in medical imaging analysis, existing models often fail to comprehensively integrate spatial and temporal tumor dynamics. This study aims to develop and validate a spatiotemporal interaction (STI) model based on longitudinal MRI data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC in breast cancer patients. Methods: This study included retrospective and prospective datasets from five medical centers in China, collected from June 2018 to December 2024. These datasets were assigned to the primary cohort (including training and internal validation sets), external validation cohorts, and a prospective validation cohort. DCE-MRI scans from both pre-NAC (T0) and early-NAC (T1) stages were collected for each patient, along with surgical pathology results. A Siamese network-based STI model was developed, integrating spatial features from tumor segmentation with temporal dependencies using a transformer-based multi-head attention mechanism. This model was designed to simultaneously capture spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of NAC response. The STI model's performance was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Precision-Recall curve (AP), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Additionally, the I-SPY1 and I-SPY2 datasets were used for Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and to explore the biological basis of the STI model, respectively. The prospective cohort was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registration Centre (ChiCTR2500102170). Findings: A total of 1044 patients were included in this study, with the pCR rate ranging from 23.8% to 35.9%. The STI model demonstrated good performance in early prediction of NAC response in breast cancer. In the external validation cohorts, the AUC values were 0.923 (95% CI: 0.859–0.987), 0.892 (95% CI: 0.821–0.963), and 0.913 (95% CI: 0.835–0.991), all outperforming the single-timepoint T0 or T1 models, as well as models with spatial information added (all p < 0.05, Delong test). Additionally, the STI model significantly outperformed the clinical model (p < 0.05, Delong test) and radiologists’ predictions. In the prospective validation cohort, the STI model identified 90.2% (37/41) of non-pCR and 82.6% (19/23) of pCR patients, reducing misclassification rates by 58.7% and 63.3% compared to radiologists. This indicates that these patients might benefit from treatment adjustment or continued therapy in the early NAC stage. Survival analysis showed a significant correlation between the STI model and both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients. Further investigation revealed that favorable NAC responses predicted by the STI model were closely linked to upregulated immune-related genes and enhanced immune cell infiltration. Interpretation: Our study established a novel noninvasive STI model that integrates the spatiotemporal evolution of MRI before and during NAC to achieve early and accurate pCR prediction, offering potential guidance for personalized treatment.

	abstract = {Background Breast cancer (BC) continues to pose a substantial global health concern, necessitating continuous advancements in therapeutic approaches. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has gained prominence as a key therapeutic strategy, and there is growing interest in the predictive utility of Background Parenchymal Enhancement (BPE) in evaluating the response of breast tumors to NAC. However, the analysis of BPE as a predictive bio-marker, along with the techniques used to model BPE changes for accurate and timely predictions of treatment response presents several obstacles. This systematic review aims to thoroughly investigate recent advancements in the analytical methodologies for BPE analysis, and to evaluate their reliability and effectiveness in predicting breast tumor response to NAC, ultimately contributing to the development of personalized and effective therapeutic strategies. Methods A comprehensive and structured literature search was conducted across key electronic databases, including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore covering articles published up to May 10, 2024. The inclusion criteria targeted studies focusing on breast cancer cohorts treated with NAC, involving both pre-treatment and at least one post-treatment breast dynamic contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) scan, and analyzing BPE utility in predicting breast tumor response to NAC. Methodological quality assessment and data extraction were performed to synthesize findings and identify commonalities and differences among various BPE analytical approaches. Results The search yielded a total of 882 records. After meticulous screening, 78 eligible records were identified, with 13 studies ultimately meeting the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Analysis of the literature revealed a significant evolution in BPE analysis, from early studies focusing on single time-point BPE analysis to more recent studies adopting longitudinal BPE analysis. The review uncovered several gaps that compromise the accuracy and timeliness of existing longitudinal BPE analysis methods, such as missing data across multiple imaging time points, manual segmentation of the whole-breast region of interest, and over reliance on traditional statistical methods like logistic regression for modeling BPE and pathological complete response (pCR). Conclusion This review provides a thorough examination of current advancements in analytical approaches for BPE analysis in predicting breast tumor response to NAC. The shift towards longitudinal BPE analysis has highlighted significant gaps, suggesting the need for alternative analytical techniques, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Future longitudinal BPE research work should focus on standardization in longitudinal BPE measurement and analysis, through integration of deep learning-based approaches for automated tumor segmentation, and implementation of advanced AI technique that can better accommodate varied breast tumor responses, non-linear relationships and complex temporal dynamics in BPE datasets, while also handling missing data more effectively. Such integration could lead to more precise and timely predictions of breast tumor responses to NAC, thereby enhancing personalized and effective breast cancer treatment strategies. © 2025 Thomas et al.

	abstract = {Introduction: This study evaluated the performance of primary foci of breast cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contributing to establish and validate radiomics-based nomograms for predicting the different pathological outcome of breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials and Methods: Retrospectively collected 387 patients with locally advanced breast cancer, all treated with NAC and received breast dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) before NAC. Radiomics signatures were extracted from region of interest (ROI) on multiparametric MRI to build rad score. Clinical-pathologic data and radiological features established the clinical model. The comprehensive model featured rad-score, predictive clinical-pathologic data and radiological features, which was ultimately displayed as a nomogram. Patients were grouped in 2 different ways in accordance with the Miller-Payne (MP) grading of surgical specimens. The first grouping method: 181 patients with pathological reaction grades Ⅳ∼Ⅴ were included in the significant remission group, while 206 patients with pathological reaction grades Ⅰ∼Ⅲ were included in the nonsignificant remission group. The second grouping method: 117 patients with pathological complete response (pCR) were assigned to the pCR group, and 270 patients who failed to meet pCR were assigned to in the non-pCR group. Two combined nomograms are created from 2 grouped data for predicting different pathological responses to NAC. The area under the curves (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were used to evaluate the performance of each model. While decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves were used for estimating the clinical application value of the nomogram. Results: Two combined nomograms embodying rad score and clinical-pathologic data outperformed, showing good calibrations for predicting response to NAC. The combined nomogram predicting pCR showed the best performance with the AUC values of 0.97, 0.90 and 0.86 in the training, testing, and external validation cohorts respectively. The AUC values of another combined nomogram predicting significant remission: 0.98, 0.88 0.80 in the training, testing and external validation cohorts. DCA showed the comprehensive model nomogram obtained the most clinical benefit. Conclusions: The combined nomogram could preoperatively predict significant remission or even pCR to NAC in breast cancer based on multiparametric MRI and clinical-pathologic data. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can downstage tumors and axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer (BC) patients. However, tumors and axillary response to NAC are not parallel and vary among patients. This study aims to explore the feasibility of deep learning radiomics nomogram (DLRN) for independently predicting the status of tumors and lymph node metastasis (LNM) after NAC. Methods: In total, 484 BC patients who completed NAC from two hospitals (H1: 297 patients in the training cohort and 99 patients in the validation cohort; H2: 88 patients in the test cohort) were retrospectively enrolled. The authors developed two deep learning radiomics (DLR) models for personalized prediction of the tumor pathologic complete response (PCR) to NAC (DLR-PCR) and the LNM status (DLR-LNM) after NAC based on pre-NAC and after-NAC ultrasonography images. Furthermore, they proposed two DLRNs (DLRN-PCR and DLRN-LNM) for two different tasks based on the clinical characteristics and DLR scores, which were generated from both DLR-PCR and DLR-LNM. Results: In the validation and test cohorts, DLRN-PCR exhibited areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.903 and 0.896 with sensitivities of 91.2% and 75.0%, respectively. DLRN-LNM achieved AUCs of 0.853 and 0.863, specificities of 82.0% and 81.8%, and negative predictive values of 81.3% and 87.2% in the validation and test cohorts, respectively. The two DLRN models achieved satisfactory predictive performance based on different BC subtypes. Conclusions: The proposed DLRN models have the potential to accurately predict the tumor PCR and LNM status after NAC. Plain language summary: In this study, we proposed two deep learning radiomics nomogram models based on pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and preoperative ultrasonography images for independently predicting the status of tumor and axillary lymph node (ALN) after NAC. A more comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition after NAC can be achieved by predicting the status of the tumor and ALN separately. Our model can potentially provide a noninvasive and personalized method to offer decision support for organ preservation and avoidance of excessive surgery. © 2022 American Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Breast cancers are complex ecosystem like networks of malignant cells and their associated microenvironment. Applications for machine intelligence and the tumoral microenvironment are expanding frontiers in pathology. Previously, computational approaches have been developed to quantify and spatially analyze immune cells, proportionate stroma, and detect tumor budding. Little work has been done to analyze different types of tumor-associated stromata both quantitatively and computationally in relation to clinical endpoints. Methods: We aimed to quantify stromal features from whole slide images (WSI) including stromata (myxoid, collagenous, immune) and tumoral components and combined them with traditional clinical and pathologic parameters in 120 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and poor clinical outcomes. Results: High collagenous stroma on WSI was best associated with lower rates of pCR, while combined high proportionated stroma (myxoid, collagenous, and immune) most optimally predicted worse clinical survival outcomes. When combining clinical, pathologic, and WSI features, Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) curves for LASSO features was up to 0.67 for pCR and 0.77 for poor outcomes. Conclusion: The techniques demonstrated in the present study can be performed with appropriate quality assurance.

	abstract = {Purpose: To describe the design, conduct, and results of the Breast Multiparametric MRI for prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Response (BMMR2) challenge. Materials and Methods: The BMMR2 computational challenge opened on May 28, 2021, and closed on December 21, 2021. The goal of the challenge was to identify image-based markers derived from multiparametric breast MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, along with clinical data for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant treatment. Data included 573 breast MRI studies from 191 women (mean age [±SD], 48.9 years ± 10.56) in the I-SPY 2/American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) 6698 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01042379). The challenge cohort was split into training (60%) and test (40%) sets, with teams blinded to test set pCR outcomes. Prediction performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with the benchmark established from the ACRIN 6698 primary analysis. Results: Eight teams submitted final predictions. Entries from three teams had point estimators of AUC that were higher than the benchmark performance (AUC, 0.782 [95% CI: 0.670, 0.893], with AUCs of 0.803 [95% CI: 0.702, 0.904], 0.838 [95% CI: 0.748, 0.928], and 0.840 [95% CI: 0.748, 0.932]). A variety of approaches were used, ranging from extraction of individual features to deep learning and artificial intelligence methods, incorporating DCE and DWI alone or in combination. Conclusion: The BMMR2 challenge identified several models with high predictive performance, which may further expand the value of multiparametric breast MRI as an early marker of treatment response.

	abstract = {Background: The biological phenotype of tumours evolves during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Accurate prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC in the early-stage or posttreatment can optimize treatment strategies or improve the breast-conserving rate. This study aimed to develop and validate an autosegmentation-based serial ultrasonography assessment system (SUAS) that incorporated serial ultrasonographic features throughout the NAC of breast cancer to predict pCR. Methods: A total of 801 patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer were retrospectively enrolled from three institutions and were split into a training cohort (242 patients), an internal validation cohort (197 patients), and two external test cohorts (212 and 150 patients). Three imaging signatures were constructed from the serial ultrasonographic features before (pretreatment signature), during the first–second cycle of (early-stage treatment signature), and after (posttreatment signature) NAC based on autosegmentation by U-net. The SUAS was constructed by subsequently integrating the pre, early-stage, and posttreatment signatures, and the incremental performance was analysed. Results: The SUAS yielded a favourable performance in predicting pCR, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.927 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.891–0.963] and 0.914 (95% CI 0.853–0.976), compared with those of the clinicopathological prediction model [0.734 (95% CI 0.665–0.804) and 0.610 (95% CI 0.504–0.716)], and radiologist interpretation [0.632 (95% CI 0.570–0.693) and 0.724 (95% CI 0.644–0.804)] in the external test cohorts. Furthermore, similar results were also observed in the early-stage treatment of NAC [AUC 0.874 (0.793–0.955)–0.897 (0.851–0.943) in the external test cohorts]. Conclusions: We demonstrate that autosegmentation-based SAUS integrating serial ultrasonographic features throughout NAC can predict pCR with favourable performance, which can facilitate individualized treatment strategies. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Achieving pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) improves survival outcomes for breast cancer patients. Currently, conventional histopathological biomarkers predicting such responses are inconsistent. Studies investigating radiomic texture analysis from breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict pCR have varied radiomic protocols introducing heterogeneity between results. Thus, the efficacy of radiomic profiles compared to conventional strategies to predict pCR are inconclusive. Purpose: Comparing the predictive accuracy of different breast MRI radiomic protocols to identify the optimal strategy in predicting pCR to NAC. Material and methods: A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Four databases were searched up to October 4th, 2021. Nine predictive strategies were compared, including conventional biomarker parameters, MRI radiomic analysis conducted before, during, or after NAC, combination strategies and nomographic methodology. Results: 14 studies included radiomic data from 2,722 breast cancers, of which 994 were used in validation cohorts. All MRI derived radiomic features improved predictive accuracy when compared to biomarkers, except for pre-NAC MRI radiomics (odds ratio [OR]: 0.00; 95 % CI: −0.07–0.08). During-NAC and post-NAC MRI improved predictive accuracy compared to Pre-NAC MRI (OR: 0.14, 95 % CI: 0.02–0.26) and (OR: 0.26, 95 % CI: 0.07–0.45) respectively. Combining multiple MRIs did not improve predictive performance compared to Mid- or Post-NAC MRIs individually. Conclusion: Radiomic analysis of breast MRIs improve identification of patients likely to achieve a pCR to NAC. Post-NAC MRI are the most accurate imaging method to extrapolate radiomic data to predict pCR. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to identify patients with pathological complete response (pCR) and make better clinical decisions by constructing a preoperative predictive model based on tumoral and peritumoral volumes of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: This study investigated MRI before NAC in 448 patients with nonmetastatic invasive ductal breast cancer (Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, n = 362, training cohort; and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, n = 86, validation cohort). The tumoral and peritumoral volumes of interest (VOIs) were segmented and MRI features were extracted. The radiomic features were filtered via a random forest algorithm, and a supporting vector machine was used for modeling. The receiver operator characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to assess the performance of the radiomics-based classifiers. Results: For each MRI sequence, a total of 863 radiomic features were extracted and the top 30 features were selected for model construction. The radiomic classifiers of tumoral VOI and peritumoral VOI were both promising for predicting pCR, with AUCs of 0.96 and 0.97 in the training cohort and 0.89 and 0.78 in the validation cohort, respectively. The tumoral + peritumoral VOI radiomic model could further improve the predictive accuracy, with AUCs of 0.98 and 0.92 in the training and validation cohorts. Conclusions: The tumoral and peritumoral multiparametric MRI radiomics model can promisingly predict pCR in breast cancer using MRI images before surgery. Our results highlighted the potential value of the tumoral and peritumoral radiomic model in cancer management. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objectives: Response assessment to neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAST) to guide individualized treatment in breast cancer is a clinical research priority. We aimed to develop an intelligent algorithm using multi-modal pretreatment ultrasound and tomosynthesis radiomics features in addition to clinical variables to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) prior to the initiation of therapy. Methods: We used retrospective data on patients who underwent ultrasound and tomosynthesis before starting NAST. We developed a support vector machine algorithm using pretreatment ultrasound and tomosynthesis radiomics features in addition to patient and tumor variables to predict pCR status (ypT0 and ypN0). Findings were compared to the histopathologic evaluation of the surgical specimen. The main outcome measures were area under the curve (AUC) and false-negative rate (FNR). Results: We included 720 patients, 504 in the development set and 216 in the validation set. Median age was 51.6 years and 33.6% (242 of 720) achieved pCR. The addition of radiomics features significantly improved the performance of the algorithm (AUC 0.72 to 0.81; p = 0.007). The FNR of the multi-modal radiomics and clinical algorithm was 6.7% (10 of 150 with missed residual cancer). Surface/volume ratio at tomosynthesis and peritumoral entropy characteristics at ultrasound were the most relevant radiomics. Hormonal receptors and HER-2 status were the most important clinical predictors. Conclusion: A multi-modal machine learning algorithm with pretreatment clinical, ultrasound, and tomosynthesis radiomics features may aid in predicting residual cancer after NAST. Pending prospective validation, this may facilitate individually tailored NAST regimens. Clinical relevance statement: Multi-modal radiomics using pretreatment ultrasound and tomosynthesis showed significant improvement in assessing response to NAST compared to an algorithm using clinical variables only. Further prospective validation of our findings seems warranted to enable individualized predictions of NAST outcomes. Key Points: • We proposed a multi-modal machine learning algorithm with pretreatment clinical, ultrasound, and tomosynthesis radiomics features to predict response to neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment. • Compared with the clinical algorithm, the AUC of this integrative algorithm is significantly higher. • Used prior to the initiative of therapy, our algorithm can identify patients who will experience pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant therapy with a high negative predictive value. © The Author(s) 2023.},

While quantitative features from medical imaging have been reported to predict treatment responses, the biological meaning of these features is not well understood, which hinders their clinical use. This study aimed to develop a deep learning signature (DLS) using pretreatment MRI to predict responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to identify the underlying pathways through paired MRI and proteomic sequencing data. The DLS achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.923 with an AUC of 0.957. Pathways including mitochondrial energy metabolism, vesicle budding and vascular transportation, protein localization to membranes, mRNA processing, and cytoskeleton-dependent trafficking were differentially regulated in patients showing pCR and were significantly correlated with DLS in the validation dataset. This study offers a biologically interpretable DLS for predicting pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, which may guide personalized medication.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning-based radiomic (DLR) model combined with clinical characteristics for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. For early prediction of pCR, the DLR model was based on pre-treatment and early treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 95 women (mean age, 48.1 years; range, 29–77 years) who underwent DCE-MRI before (pre-treatment) and after two or three cycles of NAC (early treatment) from 2018 to 2021. The patients in this study were randomly divided into a training cohort (n=67) and a validation cohort (n=28) at a ratio of 7:3. Deep learning and handcrafted features were extracted from pre- and early treatment DCE-MRI contoured lesions. These features contribute to the construction of radiomic signature RS1 and RS2 representing information from different periods. Mutual information and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used for feature selection. A combined model was then developed based on the DCE-MRI features and clinical characteristics. The performance of the models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared using the DeLong test. Results: The overall pCR rate was 25.3% (24/95). One radiomic feature and three deep learning features in RS1, five radiomic features and 11 deep learning features in RS2, and five clinical characteristics remained in the feature selection. The performance of the DLR model combining pre- and early treatment information (AUC=0.900) was better than that of RS1 (AUC=0.644, P=0.068) and slightly higher that of RS2 (AUC=0.888, P=0.604) in the validation cohort. The combined model including pre- and early treatment information and clinical characteristics showed the best ability with an AUC of 0.925 in the validation cohort. Conclusion: The combined model integrating pre-treatment, early treatment DCE-MRI data, and clinical characteristics showed good performance in predicting pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer. Early treatment DCE-MRI and clinical characteristics may play an important role in evaluating the outcomes of NAC by predicting pCR.

	abstract = {Background: Radiomics research based on whole tumors is limited by the unclear biological significance of radiomics features, which therefore lack clinical interpretability. Purpose: We aimed to determine whether features extracted from subregions defined by habitat imaging, reflecting tumor heterogeneity, could identify breast cancer patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), to optimize treatment. Methods: 143 women with stage II–III breast cancer were divided into a training set (100 patients, 36 with pathologic complete response [pCR]) and a test set (43 patients, 16 with pCR). Patients underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before NAC. With the pathological results as the gold standard, we used the training set to build models for predicting pCR based on whole-tumor radiomics (ModelWH), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-based habitat imaging (ModelHabitats), conventional MRI features (ModelCF), and immunohistochemical findings (ModelIHC). We also built the combined models ModelHabitats+CF and ModelHabitats+CF+IHC. In the test set, we compared the performance of the combined models with that of the invasive ModelIHC by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive value of the model. The DeLong test was used to compare diagnostic efficiency across different parameters. Results: In the prediction of pCR, ModelWH, ModelHabitats, ModelCF, ModelIHC, ModelHabitats+CF, ModelCF+IHC and ModelHabitats+CF+IHC achieved AUCs of 0.895, 0.757, 0.705, 0.807, 0.800, 0.856, and 0.891 respectively, in the training set and 0.549, 0.708, 0.700, 0.788, 0.745, 0.909, and 0.891 respectively, in the test set. The DeLong test revealed no significant difference between ModelIHC versus ModelHabitats+CF (p = 0.695) and ModelHabitats+CF+IHC versus ModelCF+IHC (p = 0.382) but showed a significant difference between ModelIHC and ModelHabitats+CF+IHC (p = 0.043). Conclusion: The habitat model we established from first-order features combined with conventional MRI features and IHC findings accurately predicted pCR before NAC. This model can facilitate decision-making during individualized treatment for breast cancer. © 2025 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

	abstract = {Early prediction of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) response for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients could help oncologists select individualized treatment and avoid toxic effects associated with ineffective therapy in patients unlikely to achieve pathologic complete response (pCR). The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of radiomic features of the peritumoral and tumoral regions from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) acquired at different time points of NAST for early treatment response prediction in TNBC. This study included 163 Stage I-III patients with TNBC undergoing NAST as part of a prospective clinical trial (NCT02276443). Peritumoral and tumoral regions of interest were segmented on DCE images at baseline (BL) and after two (C2) and four (C4) cycles of NAST. Ten first-order (FO) radiomic features and 300 gray-level-co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features were calculated. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to determine the most predictive features. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for performance assessment. Pearson correlation was used to assess intrareader and interreader variability. Seventy-eight patients (48%) had pCR (52 training, 26 testing), and 85 (52%) had non-pCR (57 training, 28 testing). Forty-six radiomic features had AUC at least 0.70, and 13 multivariate models had AUC at least 0.75 for training and testing sets. The Pearson correlation showed significant correlation between readers. In conclusion, Radiomic features from DCE-MRI are useful for differentiating pCR and non-pCR. Similarly, predictive radiomic models based on these features can improve early noninvasive treatment response prediction in TNBC patients undergoing NAST.

	abstract = {Background: About 15%–20% of breast cancer (BC) cases is classified as Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor type 2 (HER2) positive. The Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was initially introduced for locally advanced and inflammatory BC patients to allow a less extensive surgical resection, whereas now it represents the current standard for early-stage and operable BC. However, only 20%–40% of patients achieve pathologic complete response (pCR). According to the results of practice-changing clinical trials, the addition of trastuzumab to NAC brings improvements to pCR, and recently, the use of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab has registered further statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in terms of pCR. The goal of our work is to propose a machine learning model to predict the pCR to NAC in HER2-positive patients based on a subset of clinical features. Method: First, we evaluated the significant association of clinical features with pCR on the retrospectively collected data referred to 67 patients afferent to Istituto Tumori “Giovanni Paolo II.” Then, we performed a feature selection procedure to identify a subset of features to be used for training a machine learning-based classification algorithm. As a result, pCR to NAC was associated with ER status, Pgr status, and HER2 score. Results: The machine learning model trained on a subgroup of essential features reached an AUC of 73.27% (72.44%–73.66%) and an accuracy of 71.67% (71.64%–73.13%). According to our results, the clinical features alone are not enough to define a support system useful for clinical pathway. Conclusion: Our results seem worthy of further investigation in large validation studies and this work could be the basis of future study that will also involve radiomics analysis of biomedical images. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning (ML) models with MRI in predicting pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, we compared the pathologic complete response (pCR) prediction performance of ML + radiomics with that of a deep learning (DL) algorithm. Methods: A search for relevant studies published until December 20, 2021 was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies −2 criteria. The I2 value assessed the heterogeneity of the included studies as well as the decision to adopt a random effects model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was pooled to quantify the predictive accuracy. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression analysis, and sensitivity analysis were performed to detect potential sources of study heterogeneity. A funnel plot was used to investigate publication bias. The PROSPERO ID of our study was CRD42022284071. Result: Seventeen eligible studies encompassing 3392 patients were evaluated in the analysis. ML + MRI showed high accuracy (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.84–0.91) in predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy. In subgroup analysis, the AUC of the DL subgroup (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.88–0.97) was higher than that of the ML + radiomics subgroup (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.82–0.90) (P = 0.030). In the ML + radiomics subgroup, the studies using MRI combined with other parameters (clinical or histopathologic information; AUC = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.85–0.96) reported better performance than studies using only MRI parameters (AUC = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.78–0.86) (P = 0.009). Conclusions: ML applied to MRI enabled moderate accuracy in predicting pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, the meta-analysis showed that DL had higher predictive accuracy than ML + radiomics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: To propose a novel MRI-based hyper-fused radiomic approach to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer (BC). Materials and Methods: Pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and ultra-multi-b-value (UMB) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were acquired in BC patients who received NAT followed by surgery at two centers. Hyper-fused radiomic features (RFs) and conventional RFs were extracted from DCE-MRI or UMB-DWI. After feature selection, the following models were built using logistic regression and the retained RFs: hyper-fused model, conventional model, and compound model that integrates the hyper-fused and conventional RFs. The output probability of each model was used to generate a radiomic signature. The model's performance was quantified by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify variables (clinicopathological variables and the generated radiomic signatures) associated with pCR. Results: The training/external test set (center 1/2) included 547/295 women. The hyper-fused models (AUCs=0.81–0.85) outperformed (p<0.05) the conventional models (AUCs=0.74–0.80) in predicting pCR. The compound models (AUCs=0.88–0.93) outperformed (p<0.05) the hyper-fused models and conventional models for pCR prediction. The hyper-fused radiomic signatures (odds ratios=5.70–12.98; p<0.05) and compound radiomic signatures (odds ratios=1.57–7.71; p<0.05) were independently associated with pCR. These are true for the training and external test sets. Conclusion: The hyper-fused radiomic approach had significantly better performance for predicting pCR to NAT than the conventional radiomic approach, and the hyper-fused RFs provided incremental discrimination of pCR beyond the conventional RFs. The generated hyper-fused radiomic signatures were independent predictors of pCR. © 2025 The Association of University Radiologists},

	abstract = {Objective: Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has been widely implemented as an essential treatment to improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with locally-advanced cancer to reduce tumor burden and prolong survival, particularly for human epidermal growth receptor 2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer. The role of peripheral immune components in predicting therapeutic responses has received limited attention. Herein we determined the relationship between dynamic changes in peripheral immune indices and therapeutic responses during NAT administration. Methods: Peripheral immune index data were collected from 134 patients before and after NAT. Logistic regression and machine learning algorithms were applied to the feature selection and model construction processes, respectively. Results: Peripheral immune status with a greater number of CD3+ T cells before and after NAT, and a greater number of CD8+ T cells, fewer CD4+ T cells, and fewer NK cells after NAT was significantly related to a pathological complete response (P < 0.05). The post-NAT NK cell-to-pre-NAT NK cell ratio was negatively correlated with the response to NAT (HR = 0.13, P = 0.008). Based on the results of logistic regression, 14 reliable features (P < 0.05) were selected to construct the machine learning model. The random forest model exhibited the best power to predict efficacy of NAT among 10 machine learning model approaches (AUC = 0.733). Conclusions: Statistically significant relationships between several specific immune indices and the efficacy of NAT were revealed. A random forest model based on dynamic changes in peripheral immune indices showed robust performance in predicting NAT efficacy. ©2023 Cancer Biology & Medicine.

	abstract = {Background: Previous deep learning models have been proposed to predict the pathological complete response (pCR) and axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in breast cancer. Yet, the models often leveraged multiple frameworks, required manual annotation, and discarded low-quality images. We aimed to develop an automated and reusable deep learning (AutoRDL) framework for tumor detection and prediction of pCR and ALNM using ultrasound images with diverse qualities. Methods: The AutoRDL framework includes a You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) network for tumor detection and a progressive multi-granularity (PMG) network for pCR and ALNM prediction. The training cohort and the internal validation cohort were recruited from Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital (GPPH) between November 2012 and May 2021. The two external validation cohorts were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University (KMUH), between January 2016 and December 2019, and Shunde Hospital of Southern Medical University (SHSMU) between January 2014 and July 2015. Prior to model training, super-resolution via iterative refinement (SR3) was employed to improve the spatial resolution of low-quality images from the KMUH. We developed three models for predicting pCR and ALNM: a clinical model using multivariable logistic regression analysis, an image model utilizing the PMG network, and a combined model that integrates both clinical and image data using the PMG network. Findings: The YOLOv5 network demonstrated excellent accuracy in tumor detection, achieving average precisions of 0.880–0.921 during validation. In terms of pCR prediction, the combined modelpost-SR3 outperformed the combined modelpre-SR3, image modelpost-SR3, image modelpre-SR3, and clinical model (AUC: 0.833 vs 0.822 vs 0.806 vs 0.790 vs 0.712, all p < 0.05) in the external validation cohort (KMUH). Consistently, the combined modelpost-SR3 exhibited the highest accuracy in ALNM prediction, surpassing the combined modelpre-SR3, image modelpost-SR3, image modelpre-SR3, and clinical model (AUC: 0.825 vs 0.806 vs 0.802 vs 0.787 vs 0.703, all p < 0.05) in the external validation cohort 1 (KMUH). In the external validation cohort 2 (SHSMU), the combined model also showed superiority over the clinical and image models (0.819 vs 0.712 vs 0.806, both p < 0.05). Interpretation: Our proposed AutoRDL framework is feasible in automatically predicting pCR and ALNM in real-world settings, which has the potential to assist clinicians in optimizing individualized treatment options for patients.

	abstract = {Background: Morphological and vascular characteristics of breast cancer can change during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)-acquired pre- and mid-treatment quantitatively capture information about tumor heterogeneity as potential earlier indicators of pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC in breast cancer. Aims: This study aimed to develop an ensemble deep learning-based model, exploiting a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which merges features automatically extracted from five segmented slices of both pre- and mid-treatment exams containing the maximum tumor area, to predict and monitor pCR to NAC. Materials and Methods: Imaging data analyzed in this study referred to a cohort of 86 breast cancer patients, randomly split into training and test sets at a ratio of 8:2, who underwent NAC and for which information regarding the pCR status was available (37.2% of patients achieved pCR). We further validated our model using a subset of 20 patients selected from the publicly available I-SPY2 trial dataset (independent test). Results: The performances of the proposed model were assessed using standard evaluation metrics, and promising results were achieved: area under the curve (AUC) value of 91.4%, accuracy value of 82.4%, a specificity value of 80.0%, a sensitivity value of 85.7%, precision value of 75.0%, F-score value of 80.0%, and G-mean value of 82.8%. The results obtained from the independent test show an AUC of 81.3%, an accuracy of 80.0%, a specificity value of 76.9%, a sensitivity of 85.0%, a precision of 66.7%, an F-score of 75.0%, and a G-mean of 81.2%. Discussion: As far as we know, our research is the first proposal using ViTs on DCE-MRI exams to monitor pCR over time during NAC. Conclusion: Finally, the changes in DCE-MRI at pre- and mid-treatment could affect the accuracy of pCR prediction to NAC. © 2024 The Author(s). Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Generalizability of predictive models for pathological complete response (pCR) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients requires diverse datasets. This study employed four machine learning models to predict pCR and OS up to 7.5 years using data from a diverse and underserved inner-city population. Methods: Demographics, staging, tumor subtypes, income, insurance status, and data from radiology reports were obtained from 475 breast cancer patients on neoadjuvant chemotherapy in an inner-city health system (01/01/2012 to 12/31/2021). Logistic regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Regression models were used to predict outcomes (pCR and OS) with fivefold cross validation. Results: pCR was not associated with age, race, ethnicity, tumor staging, Nottingham grade, income, and insurance status (p > 0.05). ER−/HER2+ showed the highest pCR rate, followed by triple negative, ER+/HER2+, and ER+/HER2− (all p < 0.05), tumor size (p < 0.003) and background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) (p < 0.01). Machine learning models ranked ER+/HER2−, ER−/HER2+, tumor size, and BPE as top predictors of pCR (AUC = 0.74–0.76). OS was associated with race, pCR status, tumor subtype, and insurance status (p < 0.05), but not ethnicity and incomes (p > 0.05). Machine learning models ranked tumor stage, pCR, nodal stage, and triple-negative subtype as top predictors of OS (AUC = 0.83–0.85). When grouping race and ethnicity by tumor subtypes, neither OS nor pCR were different due to race and ethnicity for each tumor subtype (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Tumor subtypes and imaging characteristics were top predictors of pCR in our inner-city population. Insurance status, race, tumor subtypes and pCR were associated with OS. Machine learning models accurately predicted pCR and OS. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {HER2+ breast cancer (BC) is an aggressive subtype genetically and biologically heterogeneous. We evaluate the predictive and prognostic role of HER2 protein/gene expression levels combined with clinico-pathologic features in 154 HER2+ BCs patients who received trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The tumoral pathological complete response (pCR) rate was 40.9%. High tumoral pCR show a scarce mortality rate vs subjects with a lower response. 93.7% of ypT0 were HER2 IHC3+ BC, 6.3% were HER2 IHC 2+/SISH+ and 86.7% of ypN0 were HER2 IHC3+, the remaining were HER2 IHC2+/SISH+. Better pCR rate correlate with a high percentage of infiltrating immune cells and right-sided tumors, that reduce distant metastasis and improve survival, but no incidence difference. HER2 IHC score and laterality emerge as strong predictors of tumoral pCR after NACT from machine learning analysis. HER2 IHC3+ and G3 are poor prognostic factors for HER2+ BC patients, and could be considered in the application of neoadjuvant therapy. Increasing TILs concentrations, lower lymph node ratio and lower residual tumor cellularity are associated with a better outcome. The immune microenvironment and scarce lymph node involvement have crucial role in clinical outcomes. The combination of all predictors might offer new options for NACT effectiveness prediction and stratification of HER2+ BC during clinical decision-making. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Background: Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) in breast cancer contributes to treatment failure and relapse. Noninvasive methods to quantify ITH are currently limited. Purpose: To quantify ITH in breast cancer using pretreatment MRI, develop a nomogram to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), and investigate biologic pathways associated with nomogram scores. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included patients with breast cancer who underwent NAC at nine centers between April 1988 and December 2023. Tumor regions on MRI scans were clustered and integrated with global pixel distribution patterns to calculate ITH scores. A nomogram for predicting pCR was developed using multivariable logistic regression. A survival dataset was used to evaluate the association between nomogram score and RFS, and a genomics dataset was used to explore the relationship between nomogram score and biologic pathways. Results: The study included 1448 women (median age, 49 years [IQR, 43–54 years]). To predict pCR to NAC, the 505 patients from center A served as the training set, and the patients from center B, centers C–F, and center G served as three external validation sets (n = 331, 107, and 384, respectively). The survival set included patients from centers A and H (n = 179), and the genomics set included patients from center I (n = 74). The ITH score was an independent predictor of pCR (odds ratio, 0.12 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.43]; P < .001). The nomogram model achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.82, 0.81, and 0.79, respectively, in the three external validation sets. A lower nomogram score was correlated with poorer RFS (hazard ratio, 4.04 [95% CI: 1.90, 8.60]; P < .001) and was associated with upregulation of biologic pathways related to tumor proliferation. Conclusion: A nomogram model combining ITH score and clinicopathologic variables showed good performance in predicting pCR to NAC and RFS. © 2025 Radiological Society of North America Inc..

	abstract = {Rationale and objectives: To investigate the value of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)-based radiomics at baseline and after two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and associated longitudinal changes for early prediction of the NAT response in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: One hundred seventeen patients with breast cancer who underwent DCE-MRI before NAT and after two cycles of NAT from April 2019 to November 2021 were enrolled retrospectively. Patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 81) and a test set (n = 36) at a ratio of 7:3. Clinical-pathological data and the relative tumor maximum diameter regression value (diameter%) were also collected. A total of 851 radiomic features were extracted from the phase with the most pronounced tumor enhancement on DCE-MRI T1 imaging acquired both pre- and post-treatment. Delta and delta% radiomics features were also calculated. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method was applied to select features, and a logistic regression model was used to calculate pre-NAT, early-NAT, delta, and delta% radscores and then select among four radscores to build a Fusion radiomics model. The final clinical-radiomics model was constructed by combining fusion radscores and clinical-pathological variables. The discrimination and clinical utility of the models were further evaluated and compared. Results: The area under the curve (AUC) values of the fusion radiomics model based on pre-NAT, Delta, and Delta% radscores were 0.868 of 0.825. The clinical-radiomics model integrating Fusion radscores and clinical-pathological variables achieved AUC values of 0.920 of 0.884, which were higher than those of the clinical model constructed by AUC values (0.858/0.831), although no significant improvement was observed in the test set (Delong test, p = 0.196). Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the clinical-radiomics model demonstrated more clinical utility than the clinical model. Conclusion: DCE-MRI-based radiomics features may have potential for pathological complete response (pCR) prediction in the early phase of NAT.

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a machine learning model developed using radiomics data derived from physiologically decomposed diffusion-weighted MRI data for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer compared with baseline and benchmark models. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included data from the Breast Multiparametric MRI for prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Response (BMMR2) challenge dataset, comprising longitudinal multiparametric breast MRI studies (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI] and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI) from participants enrolled in the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01042379). Piecewise linear physiologic decomposition was applied to DWI data (PD DWI) to isolate pseudo-diffusion, pure-diffusion, and pseudo-diffusion fraction components for radiomics feature extraction. These features were used to develop a boosted decision tree model to predict pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Model performance was compared with performance of baseline models, including data on tumor size and mean apparent diffusion coefficient, and the BMMR2 challenge benchmark model using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, F1 score, and positive and negative predictive values. Model calibration was assessed via the Brier score, and a decision curve analysis was performed to estimate the potential reduction in unnecessary interventions when using the proposed model. Results: The study included multiparametric MRI scans from 190 female participants (mean age ± SD, 48.4 years ± 10.5). PD DWI achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.89, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.96) among all evaluated models, demonstrating statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches (all P < .04). Decision curve analysis showed that the PD DWI model provided a greater net benefit compared with the BMMR2 challenge benchmark model (0.17, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.21 vs 0.09, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.13; P < .001). Conclusion: A machine learning model using radiomics data derived from PD DWI achieved higher performance than baseline and benchmark models in predicting pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

	abstract = {Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the primary method to reduce the burden of tumor and metastasis; in the treatment of breast cancer, it may provide additional opportunities for breast-conserving surgery. Preoperative assessment of pathological complete response (PCR) to NAC is important for developing individualized treatment approaches and predicting patient prognosis. Compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography, ultrasonography (US) has the advantages of simplicity, flexibility, and real-time imaging. Moreover, it does not require radiation and can provide multi-time acquisition of the tumor during NAC treatment. Recently, deep learning radiomics models based on multi-time-point US images for the prediction of NAC effectiveness have been proposed. To further improve the prediction performance, we carefully designed four supporting modules for our proposed dual-input transformer (DiT): isolated tokens-to-token patch embedding module, shared position embedding, time embedding, and weighted average pooling feature representation modules. The design of each module considers the characteristics of the US images at multiple time points. We validated our model on our retrospective US dataset composed of 484 cases from two centers whose consistency is not sufficiently high. Patients were allocated to training (n = 297), validation (n = 99), and external test (n = 88) sets. The results show that our model can achieve better performance than the Siamese CNN and the standard tokens-to-token vision transformer without using multi-time-point images. The ablation study also proved the effectiveness of each module designed for DiT.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is typically evaluated through the assessment of tumor size reduction after a few cycles of NAC. In case of treatment ineffectiveness, this results in the patient suffering potentially severe secondary effects without achieving any actual benefit. Purpose: To identify patients achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAC by spatio-temporal radiomic analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI images acquired before treatment. Study type: Single-center, retrospective. Population: A total of 251 DCE-MRI pretreatment images of breast cancer patients. Field strength/sequence: 1.5 T/3 T, T1-weighted DCE-MRI. Assessment: Tumor and peritumoral regions were segmented, and 348 radiomic features that quantify texture temporal variation, enhancement kinetics heterogeneity, and morphology were extracted. Based on subsets of features identified through forward selection, machine learning (ML) logistic regression models were trained separately with all images and stratifying on cancer molecular subtype and validated with leave-one-out cross-validation. Statistical tests: Feature significance was assessed using the Mann–Whitney U-test. Significance of the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of the ML models was assessed using the associated 95% confidence interval (CI). Significance threshold was set to 0.05, adjusted with Bonferroni correction. Results: Nine features related to texture temporal variation and enhancement kinetics heterogeneity were significant in the discrimination of cases achieving pCR vs. non-pCR. The ML models achieved significant AUC of 0.707 (all cancers, n = 251, 59 pCR), 0.824 (luminal A, n = 107, 14 pCR), 0.823 (luminal B, n = 47, 15 pCR), 0.844 (HER2 enriched, n = 25, 11 pCR), 0.803 (triple negative, n = 72, 19 pCR). Data Conclusions: Differences in imaging phenotypes were found between complete and noncomplete responders. Furthermore, ML models trained per cancer subtype achieved high performance in classifying pCR vs. non-pCR cases. They may, therefore, have potential to help stratify patients according to the level of response predicted before treatment, pending further validation with larger prospective cohorts.

	abstract = {Purpose: To combine deep learning and biology-based modeling to predict the response of locally advanced, triple-negative breast cancer before initiating neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a biology-based mathematical model of tumor response to NAC was constructed and calibrated on a patient-specific basis using imaging data from patients enrolled in the MD Anderson A Robust TNBC Evaluation FraMework to Improve Survival trial (ARTEMIS; ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT02276443) between April 2018 and May 2021. To relate the calibrated parameters in the biology-based model and pretreatment MRI data, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed. The CNN predictions of the calibrated model parameters were used to estimate tumor response at the end of NAC. CNN performance in the estimations of total tumor volume (TTV), total tumor cellularity (TTC), and tumor status was evaluated. Model-predicted TTC and TTV measurements were compared with MRI-based measurements using the concordance correlation coefficient and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (for predicting pathologic complete response at the end of NAC). Results: The study included 118 female patients (median age, 51 years [range, 29–78 years]). For comparison of CNN predicted to measured change in TTC and TTV over the course of NAC, the concordance correlation coefficient values were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.98) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.97), respectively. CNN-predicted TTC and TTV had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.94) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.95) for predicting tumor status at the time of surgery, respectively. Conclusion: Deep learning integrated with a biology-based mathematical model showed good performance in predicting the spatial and temporal evolution of a patient’s tumor during NAC using only pre-NAC MRI data. © 2025, Radiological Society of North America Inc..

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer patients exhibit various response patterns to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However, it is uncertain whether diverse tumor response patterns to NAC in breast cancer patients can predict survival outcomes. We aimed to develop and validate radiomic signatures indicative of tumor shrinkage and therapeutic response for improved survival analysis. Methods: This retrospective, multicohort study included three datasets. The development dataset, consisting of preoperative and early NAC DCE-MRI data from 255 patients, was used to create an imaging signature-based multitask model for predicting tumor shrinkage patterns and pathological complete response (pCR). Patients were categorized as pCR, nonpCR with concentric shrinkage (CS), or nonpCR with non-CS, with prediction performance measured by the area under the curve (AUC). The prognostic validation dataset (n = 174) was used to assess the prognostic value of the imaging signatures for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) using a multivariate Cox model. The gene expression data (genomic validation dataset, n = 112) were analyzed to determine the biological basis of the response patterns. Results: The multitask learning model, utilizing 17 radiomic signatures, achieved AUCs of 0.886 for predicting tumor shrinkage and 0.760 for predicting pCR. Patients who achieved pCR had the best survival outcomes, while nonpCR patients with a CS pattern had better survival than non-CS patients did, with significant differences in OS and RFS (p = 0.00012 and p = 0.00063, respectively). Gene expression analysis highlighted the involvement of the IL-17 and estrogen signaling pathways in response variability. Conclusions: Radiomic signatures effectively predict NAC response patterns in breast cancer patients and are associated with specific survival outcomes. The CS pattern in nonpCR patients indicates better survival. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Accurate identification of pathologic complete response (pCR) from population-based electronic narrative data in a timely and cost-efficient manner is critical. This study aimed to derive and validate a set of natural language processing (NLP)-based machine-learning algorithms to capture pCR from surgical pathology reports of breast cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all invasive breast cancer patients who underwent NAC and subsequent curative-intent surgery during their admission at all four tertiary acute care hospitals in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2017. Surgical pathology reports were extracted and processed with NLP. Decision tree classifiers were constructed and validated against chart review results. Machine-learning algorithms were evaluated with a performance matrix including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value [NPV], accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], and F1 score. Results: The study included 351 female patients. Of these patients, 102 (29%) achieved pCR after NAC. The high-sensitivity model achieved a sensitivity of 90.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.6–98.9%), a PPV of 76% (95% CI, 59.6–87.2), an accuracy of 88.6% (95% CI, 78.7–94.9%), an AUC of 0.891 (95% CI, 0.795–0.987), and an F1 score of 82.61. The high-PPV algorithm reached a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI, 63.7–97%), a PPV of 81.8% (95% CI, 63.4–92.1%), an accuracy of 90% (95% CI, 80.5–95.9%), an AUC of 0.888 (95% CI, 0.790–0.985), and an F1 score of 83.72. The high-F1 score algorithm obtained a performance equivalent to that of the high-PPV algorithm. Conclusion: The developed algorithms demonstrated excellent accuracy in identifying pCR from surgical pathology reports of breast cancer patients who received NAC treatment. © 2022, Society of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: The aim of this study was to ascertain whether the utilization of multiple b-value diffusion-weighted habitat imaging, a technique that depicts tumor heterogeneity, could aid in identifying breast cancer patients who would derive substantial benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials and Methods: This prospective study enrolled 143 women (II–III breast cancer), who underwent multi-b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) before NAC. The patient cohort was partitioned into a training set (consisting of 100 patients, of which 36 demonstrated a pathologic complete response [pCR]) and a test set (featuring 43 patients, 16 of whom exhibited pCR). Utilizing the training set, predictive models for pCR, were constructed using different parameters: whole-tumor radiomics (ModelWH), diffusion-weighted habitat-imaging (ModelHabitats), conventional MRI features (ModelCF), along with combined models ModelHabitats+CF. The performance of these models was assessed based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration slope. Results: In the prediction of pCR, ModelWH, ModelHabitats, ModelCF, and ModelHabitats+CF achieved AUCs of 0.733, 0.722, 0.705, and 0.756 respectively, within the training set. These scores corresponded to AUCs of 0.625, 0.801, 0.700, and 0.824 respectively in the test set. The DeLong test revealed no significant difference between ModelWH and ModelHabitats (P = 0.182), between ModelHabitats and ModelHabitats+CF (P = 0.113). Conclusion: The habitat model we developed, incorporating first-order features along with conventional MRI features, has demonstrated accurate predication of pCR prior to NAC. This model holds the potential to augment decision-making processes in personalized treatment strategies for breast cancer. © 2024 The Association of University Radiologists},

	abstract = {Characterization of breast parenchyma in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a challenging task owing to the complexity of underlying tissue structures. Existing quantitative approaches, like radiomics and deep learning models, lack explicit quantification of intricate and subtle parenchymal structures, including fibroglandular tissue. To address this, we propose a novel topological approach that explicitly extracts multi-scale topological structures to better approximate breast parenchymal structures, and then incorporates these structures into a deep-learning-based prediction model via an attention mechanism. Our topology-informed deep learning model, TopoTxR, leverages topology to provide enhanced insights into tissues critical for disease pathophysiology and treatment response. We empirically validate TopoTxR using the VICTRE phantom breast dataset, showing that the topological structures extracted by our model effectively approximate the breast parenchymal structures. We further demonstrate TopoTxR's efficacy in predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses suggest differential topological behavior of breast tissue in treatment-naïve imaging, in patients who respond favorably to therapy as achieving pathological complete response (pCR) versus those who do not. In a comparative analysis with several baselines on the publicly available I-SPY 1 dataset (N = 161, including 47 patients with pCR and 114 without) and the Rutgers proprietary dataset (N = 120, with 69 patients achieving pCR and 51 not), TopoTxR demonstrates a notable improvement, achieving a 2.6% increase in accuracy and a 4.6% enhancement in AUC compared to the state-of-the-art method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Methods: A total of 124 patients with BC who underwent pretreatment PET-CT scanning and received NAC between December 2016 and August 2019 were studied. The dataset was randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to either the training or validation cohort. Primary tumor segmentation was performed, and radiomics signatures were extracted from each PET-derived volume of interest (VOI) and CT-derived VOI. Radiomics signatures associated with pathological treatment response were selected from within a training cohort (n = 85), which were then applied to generate different classifiers to predict the probability of pathological complete response (pCR). Different models were then independently tested in the validation cohort (n = 39) regarding their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Results: Thirty-five patients (28.2%) had pCR to NAC. Twelve features consisting of five PET-derived signatures, four CT-derived signatures, and three clinicopathological variables were candidates for the model’s development. The random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree (DT) classifiers were established, which could be utilized to predict pCR to NAC with AUC ranging from 0.819 to 0.849 in the validation cohort. Conclusions: The PET/CT-based radiomics analysis might provide efficient predictors of pCR in patients with BC, which could potentially be applied in clinical practice for individualized treatment strategy formulation.

	abstract = {Purpose: Different imaging tools, including digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), are frequently used for evaluating tumor response during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). This study aimed to explore whether using artificial intelligence (AI) for serial DBT acquisitions during NACT for breast cancer can predict pathological complete response (pCR) after completion of NACT. Methods: A total of 149 women (mean age 53 years, pCR rate 22 %) with breast cancer treated with NACT at Skane University Hospital, Sweden, between 2014 and 2019, were prospectively included in this observational cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02306096). DBT images from both the cancer and contralateral healthy breasts acquired at three time points: pre-NACT, after two cycles of NACT, and after the completion of six cycles of NACT (pre-surgery) were analyzed. The deep learning AI system used to predict pCR consisted of a backbone 3D ResNet and an attention and prediction module. The GradCAM method was used to obtain insights into the model decision basis through a quantitative analysis of the importance maps on the validation set. Moreover, specific model choices were motivated by ablation studies. Results: The AI model reached an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.63–1.00) (test set). The spatial correlation of importance maps for input volumes from the same patient but at different time points was high, possibly indicating that the model focuses on the same areas during decision-making. Conclusions: We demonstrate a high discriminative performance of our algorithm for predicting pCR/non-pCR. Availability of larger datasets would permit more comprehensive training of the models and more rigorous evaluation of their prediction performance for future patients. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become the standard therapeutic option for early high-risk and locally advanced breast cancer. However, response rates to NAC vary between patients, causing delays in treatment and affecting the prognosis for patients who do not sensitive to NAC. Materials and methods: In total, 211 breast cancer patients who completed NAC (training set: 155, validation set: 56) were retrospectively enrolled. we developed a deep learning radiopathomics model(DLRPM) by Support Vector Machine (SVM) method based on clinicopathological features, radiomics features, and pathomics features. Furthermore, we comprehensively validated the DLRPM and compared it with three single-scale signatures. Results: DLRPM had favourable performance for the prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) in the training set (AUC 0.933[95% CI 0.895–0.971]), and in the validation set (AUC 0.927 [95% CI 0.858–0.996]). In the validation set, DLRPM also significantly outperformed the radiomics signature (AUC 0.821[0.700–0.942]), pathomics signature (AUC 0.766[0.629–0.903]), and deep learning pathomics signature (AUC 0.804[0.683–0.925]) (all p < 0.05). The calibration curves and decision curve analysis also indicated the clinical effectiveness of the DLRPM. Conclusions: DLRPM can help clinicians accurately predict the efficacy of NAC before treatment, highlighting the potential of artificial intelligence to improve the personalized treatment of breast cancer patients. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study was designed to develop and validate models based on delta intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics features from breast masses on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for the prediction of axillary lymph node (ALN) pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in patients with breast cancer (BC). Methods: We retrospectively collected data from 187 BC patients with ALN metastases. Radiomics features were extracted from the intratumoral and 3 mm-peritumoral regions on DCE-MRI at baseline and after the 2nd course of NAT to calculate delta intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics features, respectively. After feature selection, the delta intratumoral radiomics (DIR) model and delta peritumoral radiomics (DPR) model were built using the retained features. An ultrasound model was constructed on the basis of preoperative axillary ultrasound results. All variables were screened by univariate and multivariate logistic regression to construct the combined model. The above models were evaluated and compared. Results: In the validation set, the ultrasound model had the lowest AUC, which was lower than those of the DIR, DPR and combined models (0.627 vs 0.825, 0.687, 0.846, respectively). The combined model constructed by delta dual-region radiomics and ultrasound dianogsis was significantly better than the ultrasound model in terms of the Delong test and integrated discrimination improvement (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Delta intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics based on DCE-MRI have the potential to predict ALN status after NAT. The combined model based on delta dual-region radiomics of breast mass can accurately diagnose ALN-pCR and provide assistance in the selection of axillary surgical approaches for patients. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Accurate identification of primary breast cancer and axillary positive-node response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is important for determining appropriate surgery strategies. We aimed to develop combining models based on breast multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging and clinicopathologic characteristics for predicting therapeutic response of primary tumor and axillary positive-node prior to treatment. Materials and methods: A total of 268 breast cancer patients who completed NAC and underwent surgery were enrolled. Radiomics features and clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed through the analysis of variance and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. Finally, 24 and 28 optimal features were selected to construct machine learning models based on 6 algorithms for predicting each clinical outcome, respectively. The diagnostic performances of models were evaluated in the testing set by the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: Of the 268 patients, 94 (35.1 %) achieved breast cancer pathological complete response (bpCR) and of the 240 patients with clinical positive-node, 120 (50.0 %) achieved axillary lymph node pathological complete response (apCR). The multi-layer perception (MLP) algorithm yielded the best diagnostic performances in predicting apCR with an AUC of 0.825 (95 % CI, 0.764–0.886) and an accuracy of 77.1 %. And MLP also outperformed other models in predicting bpCR with an AUC of 0.852 (95 % CI, 0.798–0.906) and an accuracy of 81.3 %. Conclusions: Our study established non-invasive combining models to predict the therapeutic response of primary breast cancer and axillary positive-node prior to NAC, which may help to modify preoperative treatment and determine post-NAC surgery strategy. © 2024},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop and test a radiomics nomogram based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinicopathological factors for predicting the axillary pathologic complete response (apCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases. Materials and Methods: A total of 319 patients who underwent MRI examination and received NAC treatment were enrolled from two centers, and the presence of ALN metastasis was confirmed by biopsy pathology before NAC. The radiomics features were extracted from regions of interest of ALNs before (pre-radiomics) and after (post-radiomics) NAC. The difference of features before and after NAC, named delta radiomics, was calculated. The variance threshold, selectKbest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm were used to select radiomics features. Radscore was calculated by a linear combination of selected features, weighted by their respective coefficients. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to select the clinicopathological factors and radscores, and a radiomics nomogram was built by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves. Furthermore, to explore the biological basis of radiomics nomogram, 16 patients with RNA-sequence data were included for genetic analysis. Results: The radiomics nomogram was constructed by two radscores (post- and delta- radscores) and one clinicopathological factor (progesterone hormone, PR), and showed powerful predictive performance in both internal and external test sets, with AUCs of 0.894 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.877–0.959) and 0.903 (95% CI, 0.801–0.986), respectively. The calibration curves and DCA showed favorable consistency and clinical utility. With the assistance of nomogram, the rate of unnecessary ALND would be reduced from 60.42% to 21.88%, and the rate of final benefit rate would be increased from 39.58% to 70.83%. Moreover, genetic analysis revealed that high apCR prediction scores were associated with the upregulation of immune-mediated genes and pathways. Conclusion: The radiomics nomogram showed great performance in predicting apCR after NAC for breast cancer patients, which could help clinicians to identify patients with apCR and avoid unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection. © 2025 The Association of University Radiologists},

	abstract = {Background: This study aimed to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ER+HER2- locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), a subtype with limited treatment response. Methods: We included 265 ER+HER2- LABC patients (2010–2020) with pre-treatment MRI, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and confirmed pathology. Using data from January 2016, we divided them into training and validation cohorts. Volumes of interest (VOI) for the tumoral and peritumoral regions were segmented on preoperative MRI from three sequences: T1-weighted early and delayed contrast-enhanced sequences and T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequence (T2FS). We constructed seven machine learning models using tumoral, peritumoral, and combined texture features within and across the sequences, and evaluated their pCR prediction performance using AUC values. Results: The best single sequence model was SVM using a 1 mm tumor-to-peritumor VOI in the early contrast-enhanced phase (AUC = 0.9447). Among the combinations, the top-performing model was K-Nearest Neighbor, using 1 mm tumor-to-peritumor VOI in the early contrast-enhanced phase and 3 mm peritumoral VOI in T2FS (AUC = 0.9631). Conclusions: We suggest that a combined machine learning model that integrates tumoral and peritumoral radiomic features across different MRI sequences can provide a more accurate pretreatment pCR prediction for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+HER2- LABC. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Early prediction of patient responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is essential for the precision treatment of early breast cancer (EBC). Therefore, this study aims to noninvasively and early predict pathological complete response (pCR). We used dynamic ultrasound (US) imaging changes acquired during NACT, along with clinicopathological features, to create a nomogram and construct a machine learning model. This retrospective study included 304 EBC patients recruited from multiple centers. All enrollees had completed NACT regimens, and underwent US examinations at baseline and at each NACT cycle. We subsequently determined that percentage reduction of tumor maximum diameter from baseline to third cycle of NACT serves to independent predictor for pCR, enabling creation of a nomogram (). Our predictive accuracy further improved () by combining dynamic US data and clinicopathological features in a machine learning model. Such models may offer a means of accurately predicting NACT responses in this setting, helping to individualize patient therapy. Our study may provide additional insights into the US-based response prediction by focusing on the dynamic changes of the tumor in the early and full NACT cycle. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: This study developed a nomogram model using CT-based delta-radiomics features and clinical factors to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Methods: The study retrospectively analyzed 232 ESCC patients who underwent pretreatment and post-treatment CT scans. Patients were divided into training (n = 186) and validation (n = 46) sets through fivefold cross-validation. 837 radiomics features were extracted from regions of interest (ROIs) delineations on CT images before and after nCRT to calculate delta values. The LASSO algorithm selected delta-radiomics features (DRF) based on classification performance. Logistic regression constructed a nomogram incorporating DRFs and clinical factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analyses evaluated nomogram performance for predicting pCR. Results: No significant differences existed between the training and validation datasets. The 4-feature delta-radiomics signature (DRS) demonstrated good predictive accuracy for pCR, with α-binormal-based and empirical AUCs of 0.871 and 0.869. T-stage (p = 0.001) and differentiation degree (p = 0.018) were independent predictors of pCR. The nomogram combined the DRS and clinical factors improved the classification performance in the training dataset (AUCαbin = 0.933 and AUCemp = 0.941). The validation set showed similar performance with AUCs of 0.958 and 0.962. Conclusions: The CT-based delta-radiomics nomogram model with clinical factors provided high predictive accuracy for pCR in ESCC patients after nCRT. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) is important for deciding appropriate treatment strategies for patients. In this study, we aimed to quantify the dynamic characteristics of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRI) and investigate its value to improve pCR prediction as well as its association with tumor heterogeneity in breast cancer patients. Methods: The DCE-MRI, clinicopathologic record, and full transcriptomic data of 785 breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were retrospectively included from a public dataset. Dynamic features of DCE-MRI were computed from extracted phase-varying radiomic feature series using 22 CAnonical Time-sereis CHaracteristics. Dynamic model and radiomic model were developed by logistic regression using dynamic features and traditional radiomic features respectively. Various combined models with clinical factors were also developed to find the optimal combination and the significance of each components was evaluated. All the models were evaluated in independent test set in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). To explore the potential underlying biological mechanisms, radiogenomic analysis was implemented on patient subgroups stratified by dynamic model to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways. Results: A 10-feature dynamic model and a 4-feature radiomic model were developed (AUC = 0.688, 95%CI: 0.635–0.741 and AUC = 0.650, 95%CI: 0.595–0.705) and tested (AUC = 0.686, 95%CI: 0.594–0.778 and AUC = 0.626, 95%CI: 0.529–0.722), with the dynamic model showing slightly higher AUC (train p = 0.181, test p = 0.222). The combined model of clinical, radiomic, and dynamic achieved the highest AUC in pCR prediction (train: 0.769, 95%CI: 0.722–0.816 and test: 0.762, 95%CI: 0.679–0.845). Compared with clinical-radiomic combined model (train AUC = 0.716, 95%CI: 0.665–0.767 and test AUC = 0.695, 95%CI: 0.656–0.714), adding the dynamic component brought significant improvement in model performance (train p < 0.001 and test p = 0.005). Radiogenomic analysis identified 297 DEGs, including CXCL9, CCL18, and HLA-DPB1 which are known to be associated with breast cancer prognosis or angiogenesis. Gene set enrichment analysis further revealed enrichment of gene ontology terms and pathways related to immune system. Conclusion: Dynamic characteristics of DCE-MRI were quantified and used to develop dynamic model for improving pCR prediction in breast cancer patients. The dynamic model was associated with tumor heterogeniety in prognostic-related gene expression and immune-related pathways. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) determines individualized treatment and prognosis in breast cancer patients. The study aimed to develop a biologically interpretable MRI-based radiomics model for predicting pCR. A total of 843 eligible breast cancer patients were retrospectively recruited from three medical centers and further divided into training, internal, and external validation cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from tumors and 4 mm peritumor regions on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI images. Independent clinical-pathological factors and important radiomics features were determined step by step; then a pCR-related hybrid model was constructed with AUCs of 0.802 to 0.893, which significantly outperformed the junior (AUCs of 0.623 to 0.761) and senior radiologists (AUCs of 0.648 to 0.771) with both DeLong test p < 0.05 in three cohorts. The prognostic stratification efficacy associated with disease-free survival was demonstrated in three cohorts with both log-rank p < 0.05. In terms of interpretability, the prediction contribution of the important radiomics features was first quantified by SHapley Additive exPlanation analysis. Furthermore, 120 eligible patients with DCE-MRI and bulk-RNA information were recruited from the TCGA-BRCA cohort to explore the underlying biological information for the radiomics model. Radiogenomics analysis revealed that the predicted pCR group has active immune and inflammatory pathways, while the non-pCR group performed a stronger cell proliferation and tumor invasion processes. In conclusion, these findings established an MRI-based biologically interpretable pCR predictive tool, which has the potential to individually guide clinical decision making. © 2025 UICC.},

	abstract = {Objective: Early predicting response before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is crucial for personalized treatment plans for locally advanced breast cancer patients. We aim to develop a multi-task model using multiscale whole slide images (WSIs) features to predict the response to breast cancer NAC more finely. Methods: This work collected 1,670 whole slide images for training and validation sets, internal testing sets, external testing sets, and prospective testing sets of the weakly-supervised deep learning-based multi-task model (DLMM) in predicting treatment response and pCR to NAC. Our approach models two-by-two feature interactions across scales by employing concatenate fusion of single-scale feature representations, and controls the expressiveness of each representation via a gating-based attention mechanism. Results: In the retrospective analysis, DLMM exhibited excellent predictive performance for the prediction of treatment response, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.869 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.806−0.933] in the internal testing set and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.814−0.867) in the external testing sets. For the pCR prediction task, DLMM reached AUCs of 0.865 (95% CI: 0.763−0.964) in the internal testing and 0.821 (95% CI: 0.763−0.878) in the pooled external testing set. In the prospective testing study, DLMM also demonstrated favorable predictive performance, with AUCs of 0.829 (95% CI: 0.754−0.903) and 0.821 (95% CI: 0.692−0.949) in treatment response and pCR prediction, respectively. DLMM significantly outperformed the baseline models in all testing sets (P<0.05). Heatmaps were employed to interpret the decision-making basis of the model. Furthermore, it was discovered that high DLMM scores were associated with immune-related pathways and cells in the microenvironment during biological basis exploration. Conclusions: The DLMM represents a valuable tool that aids clinicians in selecting personalized treatment strategies for breast cancer patients. © Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

	abstract = {Background: To develop and validate a peritumoral vascular and intratumoral radiomics model to improve pretreatment predictions for pathologic complete responses (pCRs) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NAC) in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods: A total of 282 TNBC patients (93 in the primary cohort, 113 in the validation cohort, and 76 in The Cancer Imaging Archive [TCIA] cohort) were retrospectively included. The peritumoral vasculature on the maximum intensity projection (MIP) from pretreatment DCE-MRI was segmented by a Hessian matrix-based filter and then edited by a radiologist. Radiomics features were extracted from the tumor and peritumoral vasculature of the MIP images. The LASSO method was used for feature selection, and the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier was trained and validated to build a predictive model. The diagnostic performance was assessed using the ROC analysis. Results: One hundred of the 282 patient (35.5%) with TNBC achieved pCRs after NAC. In predicting pCRs, the combined peritumoral vascular and intratumoral model (fusion model) yields a maximum AUC of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.88) in the primary cohort, a maximum AUC of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.76) in the internal validation cohort, and a maximum AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.78) in TCIA cohort. The fusion model showed improved performance over the intratumoral model and the peritumoral vascular model, but not significantly (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This study suggested that combined peritumoral vascular and intratumoral radiomics model could provide a non-invasive tool to enable prediction of pCR in TNBC patients treated with NAC. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this work is to compare different machine learning models for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer using radiomics features from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Method: The study included 55 patients with breast cancer, among whom 18 achieved pCR and 37 did not respond completely to NAC (non-pCR). After some pre-processing steps, 1446 features were extracted and corrected for batch effects using ComBat. Five machine learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), were evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as classification metrics. A Leave-Group-Out cross validation (LGOCV) was applied in the outer loop. Results: RF and DT models exhibited the highest performances compared to the other algorithms. DT achieved an accuracy of 0.96 ± 0.07, and RF achieved 0.95 ± 0.05. The AUC values for RF and DT were 0.98 ± 0.06 and 0.94 ± 0.07, respectively. LR and k-NN demonstrated lower performance across all metrics, while XGB showed competitive results but slightly lower than RF and DT. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of radiomics and machine learning for predicting pCR to NAC in breast cancer. RF and DT models proved to be the most effective in capturing underlying patterns in radiomics data. Further research is required to validate and strengthen the proposed approach and explore its applicability in diverse radiomics datasets and clinical scenarios. © 2025 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica e Sanitaria},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: To compare the value of radiomics and diameter% based on pre- and early-treatment dynamic enhanced MR (DCE-MRI) of the breast in predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer and to construct a tool for early noninvasive prediction of NAT outcomes. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data of 142 patients with primary invasive breast cancer who underwent DCE-MRI before and after two cycles of NAT at our institution. Enroled patients were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to the training group and the test group. Patients were divided into pathological complete response (pCR) and non-pathological complete response groups based on surgical pathology findings after NAT. The maximum diameter relative regression values (Diameter%) before and after treatment were calculated and the conventional imaging Diameter% model was constructed. Based on pre- and early-NAT DCE-MRI, the optimal features of pre-NAT, early-NAT, and delta radiomics were screened using redundancy analysis, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator methods to construct the corresponding radiomics model and calculate the Radscores. Indicators that were statistically significant in the univariate analysis of clinical data were further screened by stepwise regression and combined with Radscores to construct the fusion model. All models were evaluated and compared. Results: In the test set, the area under the curve (AUC) of the delta radiomics model (0.87) was higher than that of the pre-NAT, early-NAT radiomics models (0.57, 0.78) and the Diameter% model (0.83). The fusion model had the best efficacy in predicting pCR after NAT, with AUCs of 0.91 in the training and test sets. And its nomogram plot showed that Radscore of early-NAT radiomics had the greatest weight. In the test set, the fusion model and Delta radiomics model improved the efficacy of predicting pCR by 35.56% and 14.19%, respectively, compared to the Diameter% model (P = 0 and .039). Clinical decision curves showed the highest overall clinical benefit for the fusion model. Conclusion: Radiomics, especially delta and early-NAT radiomics, may be potential biomarkers for early noninvasive prediction of NAT outcomes. And a fusion model constructed from meaningful clinicopathological indicators combined with radiomics can effectively predict NAT response. © 2023 The Association of University Radiologists},

	abstract = {Purpose: Several predictive models have been developed to predict the pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC); however, few are broadly applicable owing to radiologic complexity and institution-specific clinical variables, and none have been externally validated. This study aimed to develop and externally validate a machine learning model that predicts pCR after NAC in patients with breast cancer using routinely collected clinical and demographic variables. Methods: The electronic medical records of patients with advanced breast cancer who underwent NAC before surgical resection between January 2017 and December 2020 were reviewed. Patient data from Seoul National University Bundang Hospital were divided into training and internal validation cohorts. Five machine learning techniques, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, and neural network, were used to build predictive models, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was compared to select the best model. Finally, the model was validated using an independent cohort from Seoul National University Hospital. Results: A total of 1,003 patients were included in the study: 287, 71, and 645 in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. Overall, 36.3% of the patients achieved pCR. Among the five machine learning models, the GBM showed the highest AUC for pCR prediction (AUC, 0.903; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.833–0.972). External validation confirmed an AUC of 0.833 (95% CI, 0.800–0.865). Conclusion: Commonly available clinical and demographic variables were used to develop a machine learning model for predicting pCR following NAC. External validation of the model demonstrated good discrimination power, indicating that routinely collected variables were sufficient to build a good prediction model. © 2023 Korean Breast Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Background: Most models of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for breast cancer (BC) suffer from insufficient data and lack interpretability. Additionally, there is a notable absence of reports from China in this field. This study is also the first to integrate the Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index (ALI) into such a model to evaluate its effectiveness. Methods: Data from 3,036 female BC patients receiving NACT at Heilongjiang Provincial Tumor Hospital (2008–2019, median follow-up 7.28 years) were analyzed. After screening, 2,909 patients were randomized into training and validation cohorts (7:3). Using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), the best predicting pathological complete response (pCR) model was identified, and key features were interpreted. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox algorithm, combined with XGBoost and Random Forest (RF) models, identified 9 overlapping prognostic features, enhancing the nomogram’s predictive accuracy for overall survival (OS). Kaplan–Meier (KM) analysis revealed varying prognostic outcomes. Results: The XGBoost model performed best in predicting pCR, with Area Under Curve (AUC) values of 0.88 and 0.72 in the training and validation sets, respectively. SHAP analysis indicated that ER, HER2 status, ALI, and albumin (Alb) level were the four most important features. The prognostic model was also validated by high AUC values in both training and test sets. KM analysis indicated that lower ALI, non-pCR, and triple-negative BC manifested as worse clinical outcomes. However, the adverse impact of ALI on the prognosis of this cohort was mainly reflected in the long-term recurrence outcomes and non-pCR groups. Conclusion: This study is the first to introduce ALI into the prediction model for BC completing NACT and develop a large-sample model based on XGBoost. Owing to the particularity of the indicators, training and validation were conducted on real clinical data. © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Background: Accurate prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has significant clinical utility in the management of breast cancer treatment. Although multimodal deep learning models have shown promise for predicting pCR from medical imaging and other clinical data, their adoption has been limited due to challenges with interpretability and generalizability across institutions. Methods: We developed a multimodal deep learning model combining post contrast-enhanced whole-breast MRI at pre- and post-treatment timepoints with non-imaging clinical features. The model integrates 3D convolutional neural networks and self-attention to capture spatial and cross-modal interactions. We utilized two public multi-institutional datasets to perform internal and external validation of the model. For model training and validation, we used data from the I-SPY 2 trial (N = 660). For external validation, we used the I-SPY 1 dataset (N = 114). Results: Of the 660 patients in I-SPY 2, 217 patients achieved pCR (32.88%). Of the 114 patients in I-SPY 1, 29 achieved pCR (25.44%). The attention-based multimodal model yielded the best predictive performance with an AUC of 0.73 ± 0.04 on the internal data and an AUC of 0.71 ± 0.02 on the external dataset. The MRI-only model (internal AUC = 0.68 ± 0.03, external AUC = 0.70 ± 0.04) and the non-MRI clinical features-only model (internal AUC = 0.66 ± 0.08, external AUC = 0.71 ± 0.03) trailed in performance, indicating the combination of both modalities is most effective. Conclusion: We present a robust and interpretable deep learning framework for pCR prediction in breast cancer patients undergoing NAC. By combining imaging and clinical data with attention-based fusion, the model achieves strong predictive performance and generalizes across institutions. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to employ novel deep-learning convolutional-neural-network (CNN) to predict pathological complete response (PCR), residual cancer burden (RCB), and progression-free survival (PFS) in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy using longitudinal multiparametric MRI, demographics, and molecular subtypes as inputs. In the I-SPY-1 TRIAL, 155 patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer with breast tumors underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The inputs were dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, and T2- weighted MRI as three-dimensional whole-images without the tumor segmentation, as well as molecular subtypes and demographics. The outcomes were PCR, RCB, and PFS. Three (“Integrated”, “Stack” and “Concatenation”) CNN were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristics and mean absolute errors. The Integrated approach outperformed the “Stack” or “Concatenation” CNN. Inclusion of both MRI and non-MRI data outperformed either alone. The combined pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy data outperformed either alone. Using the best model and data combination, PCR prediction yielded an accuracy of 0.81±0.03 and AUC of 0.83±0.03; RCB prediction yielded an accuracy of 0.80±0.02 and Cohen’s κ of 0.73±0.03; PFS prediction yielded a mean absolute error of 24.6±0.7 months (survival ranged from 6.6 to 127.5 months). Deep learning using longitudinal multiparametric MRI, demographics, and molecular subtypes accurately predicts PCR, RCB, and PFS in breast cancer patients.

	abstract = {Background: Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) has significantly increased the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), although predictors of response to this regimen have not been identified. Purpose: To investigate pretreatment perfusion MRI–based radiomics as a predictive marker for pCR in patients with TNBC undergoing NACI. Materials and Methods: This prospective study enrolled women with early-stage TNBC who underwent NACI at two different centers from August 2021 to July 2023. Pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans obtained using scanners from multiple vendors were analyzed using the Tofts model to segment tumors and analyze pharmacokinetic parameters. Radiomics features were extracted from the rate constant for contrast agent plasma-to-interstitial transfer (or Ktrans), volume fraction of extravascular and extracellular space (Ve), and maximum contrast agent uptake rate (Slopemax) maps and analyzed using unsupervised correlation and least absolute shrinkage and selector operator, or LASSO, to develop a radiomics score. Score effectiveness was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and multivariable logistic regression was used to develop a multimodal nomogram for enhanced prediction. The discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the nomogram were evaluated in an external test set. Results: The training set included 112 female participants from center 1 (mean age, 52 years ± 11 [SD]), and the external test set included 83 female participants from center 2 (mean age, 47 years ± 11). The radiomics score demonstrated an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.89) for predicting pCR. A nomogram incorporating the radiomics score, grade, and Ki-67 yielded an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.94) in the test set. Associations were found between higher radiomics score (>0.25) and tumor size (P < .001), washout enhancement (P = .01), androgen receptor expression (P = .009), and programmed death ligand 1 expression (P = .01), demonstrating a correlation with tumor immune environment in participants with TNBC. Conclusion: A radiomics score derived from pharmacokinetic parameters at pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI exhibited good performance for predicting pCR in participants with TNBC undergoing NACI, and could potentially be used to enhance clinical decision making. © RSNA, 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose To predict pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with MRI and non-imaging data at multiple treatment timepoints. Material and methods This retrospective study included breast cancer patients (n = 117) who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Data types used included tumor ADC values, diffusion-weighted and dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI at three treatment timepoints, and patient demographics and tumor data. GLCM textural analysis was performed on MRI data. An extreme gradient boosting machine learning algorithm was used to predict pCR. Prediction performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating curve along with precision and recall. Results Prediction using texture features of DWI and DCE images at multiple treatment time points (AUC = 0.871; 95% CI: (0.768, 0.974; p<0.001) and (AUC = 0.903 95% CI: 0.854, 0.952; p<0.001) respectively), outperformed that using mean tumor ADC (AUC = 0.850 (95% CI: 0.764, 0.936; p<0.001)). The AUC using all MRI data was 0.933 (95% CI: 0.836, 1.03; p<0.001). The AUC using non-MRI data was 0.919 (95% CI: 0.848, 0.99; p<0.001). The highest AUC of 0.951 (95% CI: 0.909, 0.993; p<0.001) was achieved with all MRI and all non-MRI data at all time points as inputs. Conclusion Using XGBoost on extracted GLCM features and non-imaging data accurately predicts pCR. This early prediction of response can minimize exposure to toxic chemotherapy, allowing regimen modification mid-treatment and ultimately achieving better outcomes. © 2023 Syed et al.

	abstract = {Background: Pathological complete response (pCR) is associated with favorable prognosis in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, only 30–40% of TNBC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) show pCR, while the remaining 60–70% show residual disease (RD). The role of the tumor microenvironment in NAC response in patients with TNBC remains unclear. In this study, we developed a machine learning-based two-step pipeline to distinguish between various histological components in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) of TNBC tissue biopsies and to identify histological features that can predict NAC response. Methods: H&E-stained WSIs of treatment-naïve biopsies from 85 patients (51 with pCR and 34 with RD) of the model development cohort and 79 patients (41 with pCR and 38 with RD) of the validation cohort were separated through a stratified eightfold cross-validation strategy for the first step and leave-one-out cross-validation strategy for the second step. A tile-level histology label prediction pipeline and four machine-learning classifiers were used to analyze 468,043 tiles of WSIs. The best-trained classifier used 55 texture features from each tile to produce a probability profile during testing. The predicted histology classes were used to generate a histology classification map of the spatial distributions of different tissue regions. A patient-level NAC response prediction pipeline was trained with features derived from paired histology classification maps. The top graph-based features capturing the relevant spatial information across the different histological classes were provided to the radial basis function kernel support vector machine (rbfSVM) classifier for NAC treatment response prediction. Results: The tile-level prediction pipeline achieved 86.72% accuracy for histology class classification, while the patient-level pipeline achieved 83.53% NAC response (pCR vs. RD) prediction accuracy of the model development cohort. The model was validated with an independent cohort with tile histology validation accuracy of 83.59% and NAC prediction accuracy of 81.01%. The histological class pairs with the strongest NAC response predictive ability were tumor and tumor tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for pCR and microvessel density and polyploid giant cancer cells for RD. Conclusion: Our machine learning pipeline can robustly identify clinically relevant histological classes that predict NAC response in TNBC patients and may help guide patient selection for NAC treatment. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Multi-modal image analysis using deep learning (DL) lays the foundation for neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) response monitoring. However, existing methods prioritize extracting multi-modal features to enhance predictive performance, with limited consideration on real-world clinical applicability, particularly in longitudinal NAT scenarios with multi-modal data. Here, we propose the Multi-modal Response Prediction (MRP) system, designed to mimic real-world physician assessments of NAT responses in breast cancer. To enhance feasibility, MRP integrates cross-modal knowledge mining and temporal information embedding strategy to handle missing modalities and remain less affected by different NAT settings. We validated MRP through multi-center studies and multinational reader studies. MRP exhibited comparable robustness to breast radiologists, outperforming humans in predicting pathological complete response in the Pre-NAT phase (ΔAUROC 14% and 10% on in-house and external datasets, respectively). Furthermore, we assessed MRP’s clinical utility impact on treatment decision-making. MRP may have profound implications for enrolment into NAT trials and determining surgery extensiveness. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The primary objective of this paper is to develop a machine learning-based approach capable of predicting the treatment response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to enhance breast cancer treatment management. The proposed system aims to predict NAC outcomes across three categories: pathological complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD), by analyzing multimodal magnetic resonance images with clinical and molecular subtype markers. To ensure the comprehensiveness of our system design, texture radiomics were extracted from T1, T2, and STIR MRI modalities, along with functional radiomics from diffusion-weighted MRI at various b-values. The main rationale behind employing multiple b-values in collecting DW-MRI is to effectively capture the complexities of blood diffusion within the tumor microstructure. The proposed system comprises several key steps: (i) extracting texture and functional radiomics from T1, T2, STIR MRI, and DW-MRI data; (ii) identifying the most significant radiomics correlated with NAC treatment using a genetic algorithm; (iii) initially predicting the PR from alternative treatment responses utilizing the extracted textures and functional radiomics; and (iv) subsequently integrating clinical and molecular subtype markers with imaging radiomics to differentiate between CR and SD. Our proposed system is trained and validated through the utilization of a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation approach on various MRI scans from 109 subjects, of whom 27 had complete responses, 54 had partial responses, and 28 had no responses. The performance of the proposed system was assessed through the utilization of Cohen's Kappa and accuracy metrics, achieving 81.31% and 88.07%, respectively. Our various experiments showed that integrating clinical and molecular subtype markers with radiomics highlights the proposed system's efficiency in evaluating the tumor's response to NAC efficiently, outperforming predictions based solely on individual radiomics.INDEX TERMS Breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, MRI, DW-MRI, radiomics, tumor clinical markers, machine learning, treatment response prediction. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Invasive breast cancer patients are increasingly being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy; however, only a fraction of the patients respond to it completely. To prevent overtreatment, there is an urgent need for biomarkers to predict treatment response before administering the therapy. Methods: In this retrospective study, we developed hypothesis-driven interpretable biomarkers based on deep learning, to predict the pathological complete response (pCR, i.e., the absence of tumor cells in the surgical resection specimens) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy solely using digital pathology H&E images of pre-treatment breast biopsies. Our approach consists of two steps: First, we use deep learning to characterize aspects of the tumor micro-environment by detecting mitoses and segmenting tissue into several morphology compartments including tumor, lymphocytes and stroma. Second, we derive computational biomarkers from the segmentation and detection output to encode slide-level relationships of components of the tumor microenvironment, such as tumor and mitoses, stroma, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Results: We developed and evaluated our method on slides from n = 721 patients from three European medical centers with triple-negative and Luminal B breast cancers and performed external independent validation on n = 126 patients from a public dataset. We report the predictive value of the investigated biomarkers for predicting pCR with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.66 and 0.88 across the tested cohorts. Conclusion: The proposed computational biomarkers predict pCR, but will require more evaluation and finetuning for clinical application. Our results further corroborate the potential role of deep learning to automate TILs quantification, and their predictive value in breast cancer neoadjuvant treatment planning, along with automated mitoses quantification. We made our method publicly available to extract segmentation-based biomarkers for research purposes. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the clinical utility of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) evaluated by “average” and “hot-spot” methods in breast cancer patients. Methods: We examined 367 breast cancer patients without neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) by average and hot-spot methods to determine the consistency of TIL scores between biopsy and surgical specimens. TIL scores before NAC were also compared with the pathological complete response (pCR) rate and clinical outcomes in 144 breast cancer patients that received NAC. TIL scores evaluated by the two methods were predicted from clinicopathological data using random forest regression. Results: Surgical specimens showed higher TIL scores than biopsy specimens using the hot-spot method (p < 0.001), while biopsy and surgical specimens showed similar TIL scores using the average method. There was a linear relationship between the pCR rate and TIL scores determined using hot-spot (p < 0.001) and average methods (p = 0.001). Patients without pCR and low TILs by the average method had significantly worse overall survival compared to other patients (p = 0.02). The root mean squared errors of the predicted TIL score for the test set were 19.662 (hot-spot) and 10.955 (average). Conclusion: The average method may have an advantage for breast cancer patients receiving NAC, since the TIL score using this method is more consistent between biopsy and surgical specimens, and it associates better with clinical outcomes. Our exploratory study showed that machine learning from clinicopathological data may better predict TIL scores assessed by the average, rather than hot-spot, method. © The Author(s) 2025.},

A total of 87 breast cancer patients underwent curative surgery after NAC at Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital and were randomly assigned to a training cohort and an internal validation cohort. Radiomic features were extracted from pretreatment PET images. A radiomic-score model was generated using the LASSO method. A combination model incorporating significant clinical variables was constructed. These models were externally validated in a separate cohort of 28 patients from Soonchunhyang University Buscheon Hospital. The model performances were assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC). Seven radiomic features were selected to calculate the radiomic-score. Among clinical variables, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status was an independent predictor of pCR. The radiomic-score model achieved good discriminability, with AUCs of 0.963, 0.731, and 0.729 for the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. The combination model showed improved predictive performance compared to the radiomic-score model alone, with AUCs of 0.993, 0.772, and 0.906 in three cohorts, respectively. The 18F-FDG PET-derived radiomic-based model is useful for predicting pCR after NAC in breast cancer. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Early prediction of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer patients can facilitate timely adjustment of treatment regimens. We aimed to develop and validate a MRI-based enhanced self-attention network (MESN) for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) based on longitudinal images at the early stage of NAT. Methods: Two imaging datasets were utilized: a subset from the ACRIN 6698 trial (dataset A, n = 227) and a prospective collection from a Chinese hospital (dataset B, n = 245). These datasets were divided into three cohorts: an ACRIN 6698 training cohort (n = 153) from dataset A, an ACRIN 6698 test cohort (n = 74) from dataset A, and an external test cohort (n = 245) from dataset B. The proposed MESN allowed for the integration of multiple timepoint features and extraction of dynamic information from longitudinal MR images before and after early-NAT. We also constructed the Pre model based on pre-NAT MRI features. Clinicopathological characteristics were added to these image-based models to create integrated models (MESN-C and Pre-C), and their performance was evaluated and compared. Results: The MESN-C yielded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.944 (95% CI: 0.906 − 0.973), 0.903 (95%CI: 0.815 − 0.965), and 0.861 (95%CI: 0.811 − 0.906) in the ACRIN 6698 training, ACRIN 6698 test and external test cohorts, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the clinical model (AUC: 0.720 [95%CI: 0.587 − 0.842], 0.738 [95%CI: 0.669 − 0.796] for the two test cohorts, respectively; p < 0.05) and Pre-C (AUC: 0.697 [95%CI: 0.554 − 0.819], 0.726 [95%CI: 0.666 − 0.797] for the two test cohorts, respectively; p < 0.05). High AUCs of the MESN-C maintained in the ACRIN 6698 standard (AUC = 0.853 [95%CI: 0.676 − 1.000]) and experimental (AUC = 0.905 [95%CI: 0.817 − 0.993]) subcohorts, and the interracial and external subcohort (AUC = 0.861 [95%CI: 0.811 − 0.906]). Moreover, the MESN-C increased the positive predictive value from 48.6 to 71.3% compared with Pre-C model, and maintained a high negative predictive value (80.4–86.7%). Conclusion: The MESN-C using longitudinal multiparametric MRI after a short-term therapy achieved favorable performance for predicting pCR, which could facilitate timely adjustment of treatment regimens, increasing the rates of pCR and avoiding toxic effects.

	abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the potential additional value of deep radiomics for assessing residual cancer burden (RCB) in locally advanced breast cancer, after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) but before surgery, compared to standard predictors: tumor volume and subtype. Materials and methods: This retrospective study used a 105-patient single-institution training set and a 41-patient external test set from three institutions in the LIMA trial. DCE-MRI was performed before and after NAC, and RCB was determined post-surgery. Three networks (nnU-Net, Attention U-net and vector-quantized encoder-decoder) were trained for tumor segmentation. For each network, deep features were extracted from the bottleneck layer and used to train random forest regression models to predict RCB score. Models were compared to (1) a model trained on tumor volume and (2) a model combining tumor volume and subtype. The potential complementary performance of combining deep radiomics with a clinical-radiological model was assessed. From the predicted RCB score, three metrics were calculated: area under the curve (AUC) for categories RCB-0/RCB-I versus RCB-II/III, pathological complete response (pCR) versus non-pCR, and Spearman’s correlation. Results: Deep radiomics models had an AUC between 0.68–0.74 for pCR and 0.68–0.79 for RCB, while the volume-only model had an AUC of 0.74 and 0.70 for pCR and RCB, respectively. Spearman’s correlation varied from 0.45–0.51 (deep radiomics) to 0.53 (combined model). No statistical difference between models was observed. Conclusions: Segmentation network-derived deep radiomics contain similar information to tumor volume and subtype for inferring pCR and RCB after NAC, but do not complement standard clinical predictors in the LIMA trial. Key Points: Question It is unknown if and which deep radiomics approach is most suitable to extract relevant features to assess neoadjuvant chemotherapy response on breast MRI. Findings Radiomic features extracted from deep-learning networks yield similar results in predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response as tumor volume and subtype in the LIMA study. However, they do not provide complementary information. Clinical relevance For predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, tumor volume on MRI and subtype remain important predictors of treatment outcome; deep radiomics might be an alternative when determining tumor volume and/or subtype is not feasible. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting pathological complete response (pCR) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is crucial for patients with breast cancer. In this study, we developed a multimodal integrated fully automated pipeline system (MIFAPS) in forecasting pCR to NAC, using a multicenter and prospective dataset of 1004 patients with locally advanced breast cancer, incorporating pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging, whole slide image, and clinical risk factors. The results demonstrated that MIFAPS offered a favorable predictive performance in both the pooled external test set [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.882] and the prospective test set (AUC = 0.909). In addition, MIFAPS significantly outperformed single-modality models (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the high deep learning scores were associated with immune-related pathways and the promotion of antitumor cells in the microenvironment during biological basis exploration. Overall, our study demonstrates a promising approach for improving the prediction of pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer through the integration of multimodal data.

	abstract = {Background: The I-SPY 2 trial is a national-wide, multi-institutional clinical trial designed to evaluate multiple new therapeutic drugs for high-risk breast cancer. Previous studies suggest that pathological complete response (pCR) is a viable indicator of long-term outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer. While pCR can be assessed during surgery after the chemotherapy, early prediction of pCR before the completion of the chemotherapy may facilitate personalized treatment management to achieve an improved outcome. Notably, the acquisition of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCEMR) images at multiple time points during the I-SPY 2 trial opens up the possibility of achieving early pCR prediction. Purpose: In this study, we investigated the feasibility of the early prediction of pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using multi-time point DCEMR images and clinical data acquired in the I-SPY2 trial. The prediction uncertainty was also quantified to allow physicians to make patient-specific decisions on treatment plans based on the level of associated uncertainty. Methods: The dataset used in our study included 624 patients with DCEMR images acquired at 3 time points before the completion of the chemotherapy: pretreatment (T0), after 3 cycles of treatment (T1), and after 12 cycles of treatment (T2). A convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based deep learning model, which integrated multi-time point deep image representations with clinical data, including tumor subtypes, was developed to predict pCR. The performance of the model was evaluated via the method of nested 5-fold cross validation. Moreover, we also quantified prediction uncertainty for each patient through test-time augmentation. To investigate the relationship between predictive performance and uncertainty, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was assessed on subgroups of patients stratified by the uncertainty score. Results: By integrating clinical data and DCEMR images obtained at three-time points before treatment completion, the AUROC reached 0.833 with a sensitivity of 0.723 and specificity of 0.800. This performance was significantly superior (p < 0.01) to models using only images (AUROC = 0.706) or only clinical data (AUROC = 0.746). After stratifying the patients into eight subgroups based on the uncertainty score, we found that group #1, with the lowest uncertainty, had a superior AUROC of 0.873. The AUROC decreased to 0.637 for group #8, which had the highest uncertainty. Conclusions: The results indicate that our convolutional LSTM network-based deep learning model can be used to predict pCR earlier before the completion of chemotherapy. By combining clinical data and multi-time point deep image representations, our model outperforms models built solely on clinical or image data. Estimating prediction uncertainty may enable physicians to prioritize or disregard predictions based on their associated uncertainties. This approach could potentially enhance the personalization of breast cancer therapy. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence system utilising multiregional dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and clinicopathological characteristics to predict axillary pathological complete response (pCR) after NAC in breast cancer. Methods: This study included retrospective and prospective datasets from six medical centres in China between May 2018 and December 2023. A fully automated integrated system based on deep learning (FAIS-DL) was built to perform tumour and ALN segmentation and axillary pCR prediction sequentially. The predictive performance of FAIS-DL was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RNA sequencing analysis were conducted on 45 patients to explore the biological basis of FAIS-DL. Findings: 1145 patients (mean age, 50 years ±10 [SD]) were evaluated. Among these patients, 506 were in the training and validation sets (axillary pCR rate of 40.3%), 127 in the internal test set (axillary pCR rate of 37.8%), 414 in the pooled external test set (axillary pCR rate of 48.8%), and 98 in the prospective test set (axillary pCR rate of 43.9%). For predicting axillary pCR, FAIS-DL achieved AUCs of 0.95, 0.93, and 0.94 in the internal test set, pooled external test set, and prospective test set, respectively, which were also significantly higher than those of the clinical model and deep learning models based on single-regional DCE-MRI (all P < 0.05, DeLong test). In the pooled external and prospective test sets, the FAIS-DL decreased the unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection rate from 47.9% to 6.8%, and increased the benefit rate from 52.2% to 86.5%. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that high FAIS-DL scores were associated with the upregulation of immune-mediated genes and pathways. Interpretation: FAIS-DL has demonstrated satisfactory performance in predicting axillary pCR, which may guide the formulation of personalised treatment regimens for patients with breast cancer in clinical practice.

	abstract = {We investigate the predictive value of a comprehensive model based on preoperative ultrasound radiomics, deep learning, and clinical features for pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for the breast cancer. We enrolled 155 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer who underwent NAC. The patients were randomly divided into the training set and the validation set in the ratio of 7:3. The deep learning and radiomics features of pre-treatment ultrasound images were extracted, and the random forest recursive elimination algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used for feature screening and DL-Score and Rad-Score construction. According to multifactorial logistic regression, independent clinical predictors, DL-Score, and Rad-Score were selected to construct the comprehensive prediction model DLRC. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of its predictive effect, and clinical practicability. Compared to the clinical, radiomics (Rad-Score), and deep learning (DL-Score) models, the DLRC accurately predicted the pCR status, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.937 (95%CI: 0.895–0.970) in the training set and 0.914 (95%CI: 0.838–0.973) in the validation set. Moreover, decision curve analysis confirmed that the DLRC had the highest clinical value among all models. The comprehensive model DLRC based on ultrasound radiomics, deep learning, and clinical features can effectively and accurately predict the pCR status of breast cancer after NAC, which is conducive to assisting clinical personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Early prediction of treatment response can facilitate personalized treatment for breast cancer patients. Studies on the I-SPY 2 clinical trial demonstrate that multi-time point dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCEMR) imaging improves the accuracy of predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to chemotherapy. However, previous image-based prediction models usually rely on mid- or post-treatment images to ensure the accuracy of prediction, which may outweigh the benefit of response-based adaptive treatment strategy. Accurately predicting the pCR at the early time point is desired yet remains challenging. To improve prediction accuracy at the early time point of treatment, we proposed a two-stage dual-task learning strategy to train a deep neural network for early prediction using only early-treatment data. We developed and evaluated our proposed method using the I-SPY 2 dataset, which included DCEMR images acquired at three time points: pretreatment (T0), after 3 weeks (T1) and 12 weeks of treatment (T2). At the first stage, we trained a convolutional long short-term memory model using all the data to predict pCR and extract the latent space image representation at T2. At the second stage, we trained a dual-task model to simultaneously predict pCR and the image representation at T2 using images from T0 and T1. This allowed us to predict pCR earlier without using images from T2. By using the conventional single-stage single-task strategy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.799. By using the proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy, the AUROC was improved to 0.820. Our proposed two-stage dual-task learning strategy can improve model performance significantly (p = 0.0025) for predicting pCR at the early time point (3rd week) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer patients. The early prediction model can potentially help physicians to intervene early and develop personalized plans at the early stage of chemotherapy.

	abstract = {Purpose: Build machine learning (ML) models able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer (BC) patients based on conventional and radiomic signatures extracted from baseline [18F]FDG PET/CT. Material and methods: Primary tumor and the most significant lymph node metastasis were manually segmented in baseline [18F]FDG PET/CT of 52 newly diagnosed BC patients. Clinical parameters, NAC and conventional semiquantitative PET parameters were collected. The standard of reference considered was surgical pCR after NAC (ypT0;ypN0). Eight-hundred-fifty-four radiomic features (RFts) were extracted from both PET and CT datasets, according to IBSI; robust RFTs were selected. The cohort was split in training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Four ML Models (Clinical Model, CT Model, PET Model_T and PET Model_T + N) each one with 3 learners (Random Forest (RF), Neural Network and Stochastic Gradient Descendent) were trained and tested using RFts and clinical signatures. PET Models were built considering robust RFTs extracted from either primary tumor alone (PET Model_T) or also including the reference lymph node (PET Model_T + N). Results: 72 pathological uptakes (52 primary BC and 20 lymph node metastasis) at [18F]FDG PET/CT were segmented. pCR occurred in 44.2% cases. Twelve, 46 and 141 robust RFts were selected from CT Model, PET Model_T and PET Model_T + N, respectively. PET Models showed better performance than CT and Clinical Models. The best performances were obtained by the RF algorithm of the PET Model_T + N (AUC = 0.83;CA = 0.74;TP = 78%;TN = 72%). Conclusion: ML models trained on PET/CT radiomic features extracted from primary BC and lymph node metastasis could concur in the prediction of pCR after NAC and improve BC management. © The Author(s) 2025.},

By constructing a treatment response simulator, the model utilizes cGAN to generate individualized virtual post-treatment ultrasound imaging features and integrates multi-scale features from pre- and post-treatment phases through spatiotemporal alignment and information complementarity. Experiments involving ultrasound imaging data from 171 breast cancer patients demonstrated that the model achieved an AUC of 0.873 on the test set, with sensitivity and specificity of 70.0% and 90.6%, respectively, outperforming traditional single-time-point models. The method advances the therapeutic response prediction window by 4–6 weeks through feature generation technology and employs a dual-path ResNet architecture to hierarchically fuse tumor heterogeneity features, significantly improving computational efficiency compared to conventional approaches. This research overcomes the limitations of static radiomics by providing a novel decision-support tool for clinical personalized treatment planning, though further validation through multicenter data is required to confirm the model's generalizability. © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate if a machine learning prediction model based on clinical and easily assessable imaging features derived from baseline breast [18F]FDG-PET/MRI staging can predict pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer prior to neoadjuvant system therapy (NAST). Methods: Altogether 143 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer (54 ± 12 years) were retrospectively enrolled. All women underwent a breast [18F]FDG-PET/MRI, a histopathological workup of their breast cancer lesions and evaluation of clinical data. Fifty-six features derived from positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sociodemographic / anthropometric, histopathologic as well as clinical data were generated and used as input for an extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost) to predict pCR. The model was evaluated in a five-fold nested-cross-validation incorporating independent hyper-parameter tuning within the inner loops to reduce the risk of overoptimistic estimations. Diagnostic model-performance was assessed by determining the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. Furthermore, feature importances of the XGBoost model were evaluated to assess which features contributed most to distinguish between pCR and non-pCR. Results: Nested-cross-validation yielded a mean ROC-AUC of 80.4 ± 6.0% for prediction of pCR. Mean sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 54.5 ± 21.3%, 83.6 ± 4.2%, 63.6 ± 8.5%, and 77.6 ± 8.1% could be achieved. Histopathological data were the most important features for classification of the XGBoost model followed by PET, MRI, and sociodemographic/anthropometric features. Conclusion: The evaluated multi-source XGBoost model shows promising results for reliably predicting pathological complete response in breast cancer patients prior to NAST. However, yielded performance is yet insufficient to be implemented in the clinical decision-making process. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Background: Most breast cancer (BC) patients fail to achieve pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether imaging features (perfusion/diffusion imaging biomarkers + radiomic features) extracted from pre-treatment multiparametric (mp)MRIs were able to predict, alone or in combination with clinical data, pCR to NAC. Methods: Patients with stage II-III BC receiving NAC and undergoing breast mpMRI were retrospectively evaluated. Imaging features were extracted from mpMRIs performed before NAC. Three different machine learning models based on imaging features, clinical data or imaging features + clinical data were trained to predict pCR. Confusion matrices and performance metrics were obtained to assess model performance. Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate differences between responders and non-responders. Results: Fifty-eight patients (median [range] age, 52 [45–58] years) were included, of whom 12 showed pCR. The combined model improved pCR prediction compared to clinical and imaging models, yielding 91.5% of accuracy with no false positive cases and only 17% false negative results. Changes in different parameters between responders and non-responders suggested a possible increase in vascularity and reduced tumour heterogeneity in patients with pCR, with the percentile 25th of time-to-peak (TTP), a classical perfusion parameter, being able to discriminate both groups in a 75% of the cases. Conclusions: A combination of mpMRI-derived imaging features and clinical variables was able to successfully predict pCR to NAC. Specific patient profiles according to tumour vascularity and heterogeneity might explain pCR differences, where TTP could emerge as a putative surrogate marker for pCR. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: To construct and validate a clinical-radiomics model based on radiomics features extracted from two-stage multimodal ultrasound and clinicopathologic information for early predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients treated with NAC. Materials and Methods: Consecutive women with biopsy-proven breast cancer undergoing multimodal US pretreatment and after two cycles of NAC and followed by surgery between January 2014 and November 2023 were retrospectively collected for clinical-radiomics model construction (n = 274) and retrospective test (n = 134). The predictive performance of it was further tested in a subsequent prospective internal test set recruited between January 2024 to July 2024 (n = 76). Finally, a total of 484 patients were enrolled. The clinical-radiomics model predictive performance was compared with radiomics model, clinical model and radiologists’ visual assessment by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis and DeLong test. Results: The proposed clinical-radiomics model obtained the AUC values of 0.92 (95%CI: 0.88, 0.94) and 0.85 (95%CI: 0.79, 0.89) in retrospective and prospective test sets, respectively, which were significantly higher than that those of the radiomics model (AUCs: 0.75–0.85), clinical model (AUCs: 0.68–0.72) and radiologists’ visual assessments (AUCs:0.59–0.68) (all p < 0.05). In addition, the predictive efficacy of the radiologists was improved under the assistance of the clinical-radiomics model significantly. Conclusion: The clinical-radiomics model developed in this study, which integrated clinicopathologic information and two-stage multimodal ultrasound features, was able to early predict pCR to NAC in breast cancer patients with favorable predictive effectiveness. © 2025},

	abstract = {Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) improves surgical outcomes for breast cancer patients, with pathologic complete response (pCR) correlated with enhanced survival. The role of radiomics, particularly from peritumoral tissue, in predicting pCR remains under investigation. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed radiomic features from pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans of 150 patients undergoing NACT. A proportional approach was used to define peritumoral zones, assessed both with a 10% and 30% extension, allowing more standardized assessments relative to the tumor size. Radiomic features were evaluated alongside clinical and biological data to predict pCR. The association of clinical/biological and radiomic features with pCR to NACT was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis, logistic regression, and a random forest model. A clinical/biological model, a radiomic model, and a combined clinical/biological and 4 radiomic models for predicting the response to NACT were constructed. Area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the performance of the models. Results: Ninety-five patients (average age 47 years) were finally included. HER2 +, basal-like molecular subtypes, and a high level of Ki67 (≥ 20%) were associated with a higher likelihood of pCR to NACT. The combined clinical–biological–radiomic model, especially with a 10% peritumoral extension, showed improved predictive accuracy (AUC 0.76, CI 0.65–0.85) compared to models using clinical–biological data alone (AUC 0.73, CI 0.63–0.83). Conclusions: Integrating peritumoral radiomic features with clinical and biological data enhances the prediction of pCR to NACT, underscoring the potential of a multifaceted approach in treatment personalization. © Italian Society of Medical Radiology 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard treatment for early-stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The primary endpoint of NAC is a pathological complete response (pCR). NAC results in pCR in only 30–40% of TNBC patients. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), Ki67 and phosphohistone H3 (pH3) are a few known biomarkers to predict NAC response. Currently, systematic evaluation of the combined value of these biomarkers in predicting NAC response is lacking. In this study, the predictive value of markers derived from H&E and IHC stained biopsy tissue was comprehensively evaluated using a supervised machine learning (ML)-based approach. Identifying predictive biomarkers could help guide therapeutic decisions by enabling precise stratification of TNBC patients into responders and partial or non-responders. Methods: Serial sections from core needle biopsies (n = 76) were stained with H&E and immunohistochemically for the Ki67 and pH3 markers, followed by whole-slide image (WSI) generation. The serial section stains in H&E stain, Ki67 and pH3 markers formed WSI triplets for each patient. The resulting WSI triplets were co-registered with H&E WSIs serving as the reference. Separate mask region-based CNN (MRCNN) models were trained with annotated H&E, Ki67 and pH3 images for detecting tumor cells, stromal and intratumoral TILs (sTILs and tTILs), Ki67+, and pH3+ cells. Top image patches with a high density of cells of interest were identified as hotspots. Best classifiers for NAC response prediction were identified by training multiple ML models and evaluating their performance by accuracy, area under curve, and confusion matrix analyses. Results: Highest prediction accuracy was achieved when hotspot regions were identified by tTIL counts and each hotspot was represented by measures of tTILs, sTILs, tumor cells, Ki67+, and pH3+ features. Regardless of the hotspot selection metric, a complementary use of multiple histological features (tTILs, sTILs) and molecular biomarkers (Ki67 and pH3) resulted in top ranked performance at the patient level. Conclusions: Overall, our results emphasize that prediction models for NAC response should be based on biomarkers in combination rather than in isolation. Our study provides compelling evidence to support the use of ML-based models to predict NAC response in patients with TNBC. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used in breast cancer. Predictive modeling is useful in predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to NAC. We test machine learning (ML) models to predict pCR in breast cancer and explore methods of handling missing data. METHODS Four hundred and ninety-nine patients with breast cancer treated with NAC in two centers in Singapore (National Cancer Centre Singapore [NCCS] and KK Hospital) between January 2014 and December 2017 were included. Eleven clinical features were used to train five different ML models. Listwise deletion and imputation were evaluated on handling missing data. Model performance was evaluated by AUC and calibration (Brier score). Feature importance from the best performing model in the external testing data set was calculated using Shapley additive explanations. RESULTS Seventy-two (24.6%), 18 (24.7%), and 31 (24.8%) patients attained pCR in NCCS training, NCCS testing, and KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) testing data sets, respectively. The random forest (RF) base and imputed models have the highest AUCs in the KKH cohort of 0.794 (95% CI, 0.709 to 0.873) and 0.795 (95% CI, 0.706 to 0.871), respectively, and were the best calibrated with the lowest Brier score. No statistically significant difference was noted between AUCs of the base and imputed models in all data sets. The imputed model had a larger positive predictive value (PPV; 98.2% v 95.1%) and negative predictive value (NPV; 96.7% v 90.0%) than the base model in the KKH data set. Estrogen receptor intensity, human epidermal growth factor 2 intensity, and age at diagnosis were the three most important predictors. CONCLUSION ML, particularly RF, demonstrates reasonable accuracy in pCR prediction after NAC. Imputing missing fields in the data can improve the PPV and NPV of the pCR prediction model. © 2024 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the primary treatment used to reduce the tumor size in early breast cancer. Patients who achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) after NAC treatment have a significantly higher five-year survival rate. However, accurately predicting whether patients could achieve pCR remains challenging due to the limited availability of manually annotated MRI data. This study develops a weakly and semi-supervised joint learning model that integrates multi-parametric MR images to predict pCR to NAC in breast cancer patients. First, the attention-based multi-instance learning model is designed to characterize the representation of multi-parametric MR images in a weakly supervised learning setting. The Mean-Teacher learning framework is then developed to locate tumor regions for extracting radiochemical parameters in a semi-supervised learning setting. Finally, all extracted MR imaging features are fused to predict pCR to NAC. Our experiments were conducted on a cohort of 442 patients with multi-parametric MR images and NAC outcomes. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, which leverages multi-parametric MRI data, provides the AUC value of over 0.85 in predicting pCR to NAC, outperforming other comparative methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is a challenging task clinically as it requires understanding complex histology interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information, but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning, which typically analyze small, isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients, we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs, constructs a spatial TME graph, and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy, 96.0% sensitivity, 88.0% specificity, and an AUC of 0.82, through eight-fold cross-validation, outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response, thereby helping to prevent overtreatment, improve patient quality of life, reduce treatment cost, and enhance clinical outcomes, marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a breast cancer subtype that has poor prognosis and exhibits a unique tumor microenvironment. Analysis of the tumor microbiome has indicated a relationship between the tumor microenvironment and treatment response. Therefore, we attempted to reveal the role of the tumor microbiome in patients with TNBC receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Materials and Methods We collected TNBC patient RNA-sequencing samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus and extracted microbiome count data. Differential and relative abundance were estimated with linear discriminant analysis effect size. We calculated the immune cell fraction with CIBERSORTx and conducted survival analysis using the Cancer Genome Atlas patient data. Correlations between the microbiome and immune cell compositions were analyzed and a prediction model was constructed to estimate drug response. Results Among the pathological complete response group (pCR), the beta diversity varied considerably; consequently, 20 genera and 24 species were observed to express a significant differential and relative abundance. Pandoraea pulmonicola and Brucella melitensis were found to be important features in determining drug response. In correlation analysis, Geosporobacter ferrireducens, Streptococcus sanguinis, and resting natural killer cells were the most correlated factors in the pCR, whereas Nitrosospira briensis, Plantactinospora sp. BC1, and regulatory T cells were key features in the residual disease group. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the microbiome analysis of tumor tissue can predict chemotherapy response of patients with TNBC. Further, the immunological tumor microenvironment may be impacted by the tumor microbiome, thereby affecting the corresponding survival and treatment response. © 2024 by the Korean Cancer Association.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is highly heterogeneous, resulting in different treatment responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) among patients. A noninvasive quantitative measure of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) may be valuable for predicting treatment response. Purpose: To develop a quantitative measure of ITH on pretreatment MRI scans and test its performance for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAC in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Pretreatment MRI scans were retrospectively acquired in patients with breast cancer who received NAC followed by surgery at multiple centers from January 2000 to September 2020. Conventional radiomics (hereafter, C-radiomics) and intratumoral ecological diversity features were extracted from the MRI scans, and output probabilities of imaging-based decision tree models were used to generate a C-radiomics score and ITH index. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with pCR, and significant variables, including clinicopathologic variables, C-radiomics score, and ITH index, were combined into a predictive model for which performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The training data set was comprised of 335 patients (median age, 48 years [IQR, 42-54 years]) from centers A and B, and 590, 280, and 384 patients (median age, 48 years [IQR, 41-55 years]) were included in the three external test data sets. Molecular subtype (odds ratio [OR] range, 4.76-8.39 [95% CI: 1.79, 24.21]; all P < .01), ITH index (OR, 30.05 [95% CI: 8.43, 122.64]; P < .001), and C-radiomics score (OR, 29.90 [95% CI: 12.04, 81.70]; P < .001) were independently associated with the odds of achieving pCR. The combined model showed good performance for predicting pCR to NAC in the training data set (AUC, 0.90) and external test data sets (AUC range, 0.83-0.87). Conclusion: A model that combined an index created from pretreatment MRI-based imaging features quantitating ITH, C-radiomics score, and clinicopathologic variables showed good performance for predicting pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer. © 2023 Radiological Society of North America Inc..

	abstract = {Background. Machine learning classifiers are increasingly used to create predictive models for pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Few studies have compared the effectiveness of different ML classifiers. This study evaluated radiomics models based on pre- and post-contrast first-phase T1 weighted images (T1WI) in predicting breast cancer pCR after NAT and compared the performance of ML classifiers. Methods. This retrospective study enrolled 281 patients undergoing NAT from the Duke-Breast-Cancer-MRI dataset. Radiomic features were extracted from pre- and post-contrast first-phase T1WI images. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, then the dataset was randomly divided into training and validation groups (7:3). The radiomics model was built using selected optimal features. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) were classifiers. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess predictive performance. Results. LightGBM performed best in predicting pCR [area under the curve (AUC): 0.823, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.743–0.902], accuracy 74.0%, sensitivity 85.0%, specificity 67.2%]. During subgroup analysis, RF was most effective in pCR prediction in luminal breast cancers (AUC: 0.914, 95% CI [0.847–0.981], accuracy 87.0%, sensitivity 85.2%, specificity 88.1%). In triple-negative breast cancers, LightGBM performed best (AUC: 0.836, 95% CI [0.708–0.965], accuracy 78.6%, sensitivity 68.2%, specificity 90.0%). Conclusion. The LightGBM-based radiomics model performed best in predicting pCR in patients with breast cancer. RF and LightGBM showed promising results for luminal and triple-negative breast cancers, respectively. © 2024 Li et al.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning radiomics (DLR) model based on longitudinal ultrasound data and clinical features to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients. Methods: Between January 2018 and June 2023, 312 patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned to a training cohort (n = 219) and a test cohort (n = 93) in a 7:3 ratio. Next, pre-NAC and post-treatment 2-cycle ultrasound images were collected, and radiomics and deep learning features were extracted from NAC pre-treatment (Pre), post-treatment 2 cycle (Post), and Delta (pre-NAC—NAC 2 cycle) images. In the training cohort, to filter features, the intraclass correlation coefficient test, the Boruta algorithm, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression were used. Single-modality models (Pre, Post, and Delta) were constructed based on five machine-learning classifiers. Finally, based on the classifier with the optimal predictive performance, the DLR model was constructed by combining Pre, Post, and Delta ultrasound features and was subsequently combined with clinical features to develop a combined model (Integrated). The discriminative power, predictive performance, and clinical utility of the models were further evaluated in the test cohort. Furthermore, patients were assigned into three subgroups, including the HR+/HER2-, HER2+, and TNBC subgroups, according to molecular typing to validate the predictability of the model across the different subgroups. Results: After feature screening, 16, 13, and 10 features were selected to construct the Pre model, Post model, and Delta model based on the five machine learning classifiers, respectively. The three single-modality models based on the XGBoost classifier displayed optimal predictive performance. Meanwhile, the DLR model (AUC of 0.827) was superior to the single-modality model (Pre, Post, and Delta AUCs of 0.726, 0.776, and 0.710, respectively) in terms of prediction performance. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis identified Her-2 status and histological grade as independent risk factors for NAC response in breast cancer. In both the training and test cohorts, the Integrated model, which included Pre, Post, and Delta ultrasound features and clinical features, exhibited the highest predictive ability, with AUC values of 0.924 and 0.875, respectively. Likewise, the Integrated model displayed the highest predictive performance across the different subgroups. Conclusion: The Integrated model, which incorporated pre-NAC treatment and early treatment ultrasound data and clinical features, accurately predicted pCR after NAC in breast cancer patients and provided valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies, allowing for timely adjustment of chemotherapy regimens. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE The optimal characteristics among patients with breast cancer to recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an active area of clinical research. We developed and compared several approaches to developing prediction models for pathologic complete response (pCR) among patients with breast cancer in Alberta. METHODS The study included all patients with breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Alberta between 2012 and 2014 identified from the Alberta Cancer Registry. Patient, tumor, and treatment data were obtained through primary chart review. pCR was defined as no residual invasive tumor at surgical excision in breast or axilla. Two types of prediction models for pCR were built: (1) expert model: variables selected on the basis of oncologists’ opinions and (2) data-driven model: variables selected by trained machine. These model types were fit using logistic regression (LR), random forests (RF), and gradient-boosted trees (GBT). We compared the models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and integrated calibration index, and internally validated using bootstrap resampling. RESULTS A total of 363 cases were included in the analyses, of which 86 experienced pCR. The RF and GBT fits yielded higher optimism-corrected area under the receiver operating characteristic curves compared with LR for the expert (RF: 0.70; GBT: 0.69; LR: 0.65) and data-driven models (RF: 0.71; GBT: 0.68; LR: 0.64). The LR fit yielded the lowest integrated calibration indices for the expert (LR: 0.037; GBT: 0.05; RF: 0.10) and data-driven models (LR: 0.026; GBT: 0.06; RF: 0.099). CONCLUSION Our models demonstrated predictive ability for pCR using routinely collected clinical and demographic variables. We show that machine learning fit methods can be used to optimize models for pCR prediction. We also show that additional variables beyond clinical expertise do not considerably improve predictive ability and may not be of value on the basis of the burden of data collection. © 2022 by American Society of Clinical Oncology},

	abstract = {Objectives: We aimed to determine whether radiomic features extracted from a highly homogeneous database of breast MRI could non-invasively predict pathological complete responses (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with breast cancer. Methods: One hundred patients with breast cancer receiving NACT in a single center (01/2017–06/2019) and undergoing breast MRI were retrospectively evaluated. For each patient, radiomic features were extracted within the biopsy-proven tumor on T1-weighted (T1-w) contrast-enhanced MRI performed before NACT. The pCR to NACT was determined based on the final surgical specimen. The association of clinical/biological and radiomic features with response to NACT was evaluated by univariate and multivariable analysis by using random forest and logistic regression. The performances of all models were assessed using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Eighty-three patients (mean (SD) age, 47.26 (8.6) years) were included. Patients with HER2+, basal-like molecular subtypes and Ki67 ≥ 20% presented a pCR to NACT more frequently; the clinical/biological model’s AUC (95% CI) was 0.81 (0.71–0.90). Using 136 representative radiomics features selected through cluster analysis from the 1037 extracted features, a radiomic score was calculated to predict the response to NACT, with AUC (95% CI): 0.64 (0.51–0.75). After combining the clinical/biological and radiomics models, the AUC (95% CI) was 0.83 (0.73–0.92). Conclusions: MRI-based radiomic features slightly improved the pre-treatment prediction of pCR to NACT, in addiction to biological characteristics. If confirmed on larger cohorts, it could be helpful to identify such patients, to avoid unnecessary treatment. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background: To assess the value of radiomics based on multiphases contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) for early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in patients with human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive invasive breast cancer. Methods: A total of 127 patients with newly diagnosed primary HER2 positive invasive breast cancer underwent CE-MRI before NAT and performed surgery after NAT. Radiomic features were extracted from the 1st postcontrast CE-MRI phase (CEi) and multi-phases CE- MRI (CEm),respectively. With selected features using a forward stepwise regression, 23 machine learning classifiers based on CE1 and CEm were constructed respectively for differentiating pCR and non-pCR patients. The performances of classifiers were assessed and compared by their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC (area under curve). The optimal machine learning classification was used to discriminate pCR vs non-pCR in mass and non-mass groups, uni-focal and unilateral multi-focal groups, respectively. Results: For the task of pCR classification, 6 radiomic features from CE1 and 6 from CEm were selected for the construction of machine learning models, respectively. The linear SVM based on CEm outperformed the logistic regression model using CE1 with an AUC of 0.84 versus 0.69. In mass and non-mass enhancement groups, the accuracy of linear SVM achieved 84% and 76%. Whereas in unifocal and unilateral multifocal cases, 79% and 75% accuracy were achieved by linear SVM. Conclusion: Multiphases CE-MRI imaging may offer more heterogeneity information in the tumor and provide a non-invasive approach for early prediction of pCR to NAT in patients with HER2-positive invasive breast cancer. © 2021 Li et al.},

Methods Ninety-one patients were analyzed. A total of 396 radiomics features were extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was selected for data dimension reduction to build a radiomics signature. Finally, the nomogram was built to predict PCR. Results The radiomics signature of the model that combined DCE-MRI and ADC maps showed a higher performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.848) than the models with DCE-MRI (AUC, 0.750) or ADC maps (AUC, 0.785) alone in the training set. The proposed model, which included combined radiomics signature, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor, yielded a maximum AUC of 0.837 in the testing set. Conclusions The combined radiomics features from DCE-MRI and ADC data may serve as potential predictor markers for predicting PCR. The nomogram could be used as a quantitative tool to predict PCR.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The proposed deep learning model trained on all datasets as clinical information, T1-weighted subtraction images, and T2-weighted images shows better performance with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.888 as compared to the model using only clinical information (AUC = 0.827, P < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that the multimodal fusion approach using deep learning with both clinical information and MR images achieve higher prediction performance compared to the deep learning model without the fusion approach. Deep learning could integrate pretreatment MR images with clinical information to improve pCR prediction performance. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: The purpose of this study was to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer using radiomics based on pretreatment staging contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). Patients and Methods: A total of 215 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Based on the intratumoral and peritumoral regions of CECT images, radiomic features were extracted and selected, respectively, to develop an intratumoral signature and a peritumoral signature with logistic regression in a training dataset (138 patients from November 2015 to October 2017). We also developed a clinical model with the molecular characterization of the tumor. A radiomic nomogram was further constructed by incorporating the intratumoral and peritumoral signatures with molecular characterization. The performance of the nomogram was validated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility in an independent validation dataset (77 patients from November 2017 to December 2018). Stratified analysis was performed to develop a subtype-specific radiomic signature for each subgroup. Results: Compared with the clinical model (area under the curve [AUC], 0.756), the radiomic nomogram (AUC, 0.818) achieved better performance for pCR prediction in the validation dataset with continuous net reclassification improvement of 0.787 and good calibration. Decision curve analysis suggested the nomogram was clinically useful. Subtype-specific radiomic signatures showed improved AUCs (luminal subgroup, 0.936; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive subgroup, 0.825; and triple negative subgroup, 0.858) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: This study has revealed a predictive value of pretreatment staging-CECT and successfully developed and validated a radiomic nomogram for individualized prediction of pCR to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer, which could assist clinical decision-making and improve patient outcome. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to assess whether multiparametric18F-FDG PET/MRI-based radiomics analysis is able to predict pathological complete response in breast cancer patients and hence potentially enhance pretherapeutic patient stratification. Methods: A total of 73 female patients (mean age 49 years; range 27–77 years) with newly diagnosed, therapy-naive breast cancer underwent simultaneous18F-FDG PET/MRI and were included in this retrospective study. All PET/MRI datasets were imported to dedicated software (ITK-SNAP v. 3.6.0) for lesion annotation using a semi-automated method. Pretreatment biopsy specimens were used to determine tumor histology, tumor and nuclear grades, and immunohistochemical status. Histopathological results from surgical tumor specimens were used as the reference standard to distinguish between complete pathological response (pCR) and noncomplete pathological response. An elastic net was employed to select the most important radiomic features prior to model development. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated for each model. Results: The best results in terms of AUCs and NPV for predicting complete pathological response in the entire cohort were obtained by the combination of all MR sequences and PET (0.8 and 79.5%, respectively), and no significant differences from the other models were observed. In further subgroup analyses, combining all MR and PET data, the best AUC (0.94) for predicting complete pathologic response was obtained in the HR+/HER2− group. No difference between results with/without the inclusion of PET characteristics was observed in the TN/HER2+ group, each leading to an AUC of 0.92 for all MR and all MR + PET datasets. Conclusion:18F-FDG PET/MRI enables comprehensive high-quality radiomics analysis for the prediction of pCR in breast cancer patients, especially in those with HR+/HER2− receptor status. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: For breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), pathologic complete response (pCR; no invasive or in situ) cannot be assessed non-invasively so all patients undergo surgery. The aim of our study was to develop and validate a radiomics classifier that classifies breast cancer pCR post-NAC on MRI prior to surgery. Methods: This retrospective study included women treated with NAC for breast cancer from 2014 to 2016 with (1) pre- and post-NAC breast MRI and (2) post-NAC surgical pathology report assessing response. Automated radiomics analysis of pre- and post-NAC breast MRI involved image segmentation, radiomics feature extraction, feature pre-filtering, and classifier building through recursive feature elimination random forest (RFE-RF) machine learning. The RFE-RF classifier was trained with nested five-fold cross-validation using (a) radiomics only (model 1) and (b) radiomics and molecular subtype (model 2). Class imbalance was addressed using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Results: Two hundred seventy-three women with 278 invasive breast cancers were included; the training set consisted of 222 cancers (61 pCR, 161 no-pCR; mean age 51.8 years, SD 11.8), and the independent test set consisted of 56 cancers (13 pCR, 43 no-pCR; mean age 51.3 years, SD 11.8). There was no significant difference in pCR or molecular subtype between the training and test sets. Model 1 achieved a cross-validation AUROC of 0.72 (95% CI 0.64, 0.79) and a similarly accurate (P = 0.1) AUROC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.71, 0.94) in both the training and test sets. Model 2 achieved a cross-validation AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.72, 0.87) and a similar (P = 0.9) AUROC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.62, 0.94) in both the training and test sets. Conclusions: This study validated a radiomics classifier combining radiomics with molecular subtypes that accurately classifies pCR on MRI post-NAC. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: To compare the performances of deep learning (DL) to radiomics analysis (RA) in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) based on pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in breast cancer. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 356 breast cancer patients who underwent DCE-MRI before NAC and underwent surgery after NAC. Image features and kinetic parameters of tumors were derived from DCE-MRI. Molecular information was assessed based on immunohistochemistry results. The image-based RA and DL models were constructed by adding kinetic parameters or molecular information to image-only linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The predictive performances of developed models were assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and compared with the DeLong method. Results: The overall pCR rate was 23.3% (83/356). The area under the ROC (AUROC) of the image-kinetic-molecular RA model was 0.781 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.735, 0.828], which was higher than that of the image-kinetic RA model (0.629, 95% CI: 0.595, 0.663; P < 0.001) and comparable to that of the image-molecular RA model (0.755, 95% CI: 0.708, 0.802; P = 0.133). The AUROC of the image-kinetic-molecular DL model was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.816, 0.847), which was higher than that of the image-kinetic and image-molecular DL models (0.707, 95% CI: 0.654, 0.761; 0.79, 95% CI: 0.768, 0.812; P < 0.001) and higher than that of the image-kinetic-molecular RA model (0.778, 95% CI: 0.735, 0.828; P < 0.001). Conclusions: The pretreatment DCE-MRI-based DL model is superior to the RA model in predicting pCR to NAC in breast cancer patients. The image-kinetic-molecular DL model has the best prediction performance. Copyright © 2022 Peng, Cheng, Gong, Zheng, Zhang, Wu, Yang, Yang, Zheng and Shen.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is commonly accepted as the gold standard to assess outcome after NAC in breast cancer patients. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has unique value in tumor staging, predicting prognosis, and evaluating treatment response. Our aim was to determine if we could identify radiomic predictors from PET/CT in breast cancer patient therapeutic efficacy prior to NAC. Methods: This retrospective study included 100 breast cancer patients who received NAC; there were 2210 PET/CT radiomic features extracted. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning models were used to identify the prognostic radiomic predictors through the following: (1) selection of the significant (p < 0.05) imaging features from consensus clustering and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test; (2) selection of the most discriminative features via univariate random forest (Uni-RF) and the Pearson correlation matrix (PCM); and (3) determination of the most predictive features from a traversal feature selection (TFS) based on a multivariate random forest (RF). The prediction model was constructed with RF and then validated with 10-fold cross-validation for 30 times and then independently validated. The performance of the radiomic predictors was measured in terms of area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Results: The PET/CT radiomic predictors achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.857 (AUC = 0.844) on the training split set and 0.767 (AUC = 0.722) on the independent validation set. When age was incorporated, the accuracy for the split set increased to 0.857 (AUC = 0.958) and 0.8 (AUC = 0.73) for the independent validation set and both outperformed the clinical prediction model. We also found a close association between the radiomic features, receptor expression, and tumor T stage. Conclusion: Radiomic predictors from pre-treatment PET/CT scans when combined with patient age were able to predict pCR after NAC. We suggest that these data will be valuable for patient management. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Pathological complete response (pCR) is considered a surrogate endpoint for favorable survival in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Predictive biomarkers of treatment response are crucial for guiding treatment decisions. With the hypothesis that histological information on tumor biopsy images could predict NAC response in breast cancer, we proposed a novel deep learning (DL)-based biomarker that predicts pCR from images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue and evaluated its predictive performance. Methods: In total, 540 breast cancer patients receiving standard NAC were enrolled. Based on H&E-stained images, DL methods were employed to automatically identify tumor epithelium and predict pCR by scoring the identified tumor epithelium to produce a histopathological biomarker, the pCR-score. The predictive performance of the pCR-score was assessed and compared with that of conventional biomarkers including stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) and subtype. Results: The pCR-score derived from H&E staining achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.847 in predicting pCR directly, and achieved accuracy, F1 score, and AUC of 0.853, 0.503, and 0.822 processed by the logistic regression method, respectively, higher than either sTILs or subtype; a prediction model of pCR constructed by integrating sTILs, subtype and pCR-score yielded a mean AUC of 0.890, outperforming the baseline sTIL-subtype model by 0.051 (0.839, P = 0.001). Conclusion: The DL-based pCR-score from histological images is predictive of pCR better than sTILs and subtype, and holds the great potentials for a more accurate stratification of patients for NAC. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of wavelet-transformed radiomic MRI in predicting the pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Methods: Fifty-five female patients with LABC who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) examination prior to NAC were collected for the retrospective study. According to the pathological assessment after NAC, patient responses to NAC were categorized into pCR and non-pCR. Three groups of radiomic textures were calculated in the segmented lesions, including (1) volumetric textures, (2) peripheral textures, and (3) wavelet-transformed textures. Six models for the prediction of pCR were Model I: group (1), Model II: group (1) + (2), Model III: group (3), Model IV: group (1) + (3), Model V: group (2) + (3), and Model VI: group (1) + (2) + (3). The performance of predicting models was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC). Results: The AUCs of the six models for the prediction of pCR were 0.816 ± 0.033 (Model I), 0.823 ± 0.020 (Model II), 0.888 ± 0.025 (Model III), 0.876 ± 0.015 (Model IV), 0.885 ± 0.030 (Model V), and 0.874 ± 0.019 (Model VI). The performance of four models with wavelet-transformed textures (Models III, IV, V, and VI) was significantly better than those without wavelet-transformed textures (Model I and II). In addition, the inclusion of volumetric textures or peripheral textures or both did not result in any improvements in performance. Conclusions: Wavelet-transformed textures outperformed volumetric and/or peripheral textures in the radiomic MRI prediction of pCR to NAC for patients with LABC, which can potentially serve as a surrogate biomarker for the prediction of the response of LABC to NAC. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response is an important indicator of patient survival in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), but predicting chemosensitivity remains a challenge in clinical practice. We developed an 86-gene-based random forest (RF) classifier capable of predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response (pathological Complete Response (pCR) or Residual Disease (RD)) in TNBC patients. The performance of pCR classification of the proposed model was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Precision Recall (PR) curve. The AUROC and AUPRC of the proposed model on the test set were 0.891 and 0.829, respectively. At a predefined specificity (>90%), the proposed model shows a superior sensitivity compared to the best performing reported NAC response prediction model (69.2% vs. 36.9%). Moreover, the predicted pCR status by the model well explains the distance recurrence free survival (DRFS) of TNBC patients. In addition, the pCR probabilities of the proposed model using the expression profiles of the CCLE TNBC cell lines show a high Spearman rank correlation with cyclophosphamide sensitivity in the TNBC cell lines (SRCC = 0.697, p-value= 0.031). Associations between the 86 genes and DNA repair/cell cycle mechanisms were provided through function enrichment analysis. Our study suggests that the random forest-based prediction model provides a reliable prediction of the clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and may explain chemosensitivity in TNBC. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {In patients with locally advanced breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), some patients achieve a complete pathologic response (pCR), some achieve a partial response, and some do not respond at all or even progress. Accurate prediction of treatment response has the potential to improve patient care by improving prognostication, enabling de-escalation of toxic treatment that has little benefit, facilitating upfront use of novel targeted therapies, and avoiding delays to surgery. Visual inspection of a patient's tumor on multiparametric MRI is insufficient to predict that patient's response to NAC. However, machine learning and deep learning approaches using a mix of qualitative and quantitative MRI features have recently been applied to predict treatment response early in the course of or even before the start of NAC. This is a novel field but the data published so far has shown promising results. We provide an overview of the machine learning and deep learning models developed to date, as well as discuss some of the challenges to clinical implementation. © 2019 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the ability of radiomic signatures based on MRI to evaluate the response and efficiency of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for treating breast cancers. Methods: 152 patients were included in this study at our institution between March 2017 and September 2019. All patients with breast cancer underwent a preoperative breast MRI and the Miller-Payne grading system was applied to evaluate response to NAC. Quantitative parameters were compared between patients with sensitive and insensitive responses to NAC and between those with pathological complete responses (pCR) and non-pCR. Four radiomic signatures were built based on T2W imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging and their combination, and radiomics scores (Rad-score) were calculated. The combination of the clinical factors and Rad-scores created a nomogram model. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association between MRI features and independent clinical risk factors. Results: 20 features and 18 features were selected to build the radiomic signature for evaluating sensitivity and the possibility of pCR, respectively. The combined radiomic signature and nomogram model showed a similar discrimination in the training (AUC 0.91, 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.96, 0.86-0.98) and validation (AUC 0.93, 0.91, 95%CI, 0.86-1.00, 0.82-1.00) sets. The clinical factor model exhibited reduced performance (AUC 0.74, 0.64, 95%CI, 0.64-0.84, 0.46-0.82) in terms of NAC sensitivity and pCR. Conclusions: The combined radiomic signature and nomogram model exhibited potential predictive power for predicting effective NAC treatment which can aid in the prognosis and guidance of treatment regimens. © 2020 British Institute of Radiology.

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Chemotherapy is useful to many breast cancer patients, however, it is not therapeutic for some patients. Pathologic complete response (pCR) is an indicator to good response in Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). In this study, we aimed to develop a way to predict pCR before NAC. Methods: We retrospectively collected 287 stage II-III breast cancer cases either to a training set (N = 197) or to a test set (N = 90). Fourteen candidate genes were selected from four public microarray data sets. A prediction model was built, by using these fourteen candidate genes and three reference genes expression which were tested by TaqMan probe-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction, after selecting a better algorithm. Results: The Naive Bayes algorithm had a relatively higher predictive value, compared with random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (knn) algorithms (P < 0.05). This 17-gene prediction model showed a high positive correlation with pCR (odds ratio, 8.914, 95% confidence interval, 4.430–17.934, P < 0.001). By using this model, the enrolled patients were classified into sensitive (SE) and insensitive (INS) groups. The pCR rates between the SE and INS groups were highly different (42.3% vs.7.6%, P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of this prediction model were 84.5% and 62.0%. Conclusions: Instead of whole transcriptome-based technologies, panel gene expression with tens of essential genes implemented in a machine learning model has predictive potential for chemosensitivity in breast cancers. © 2020},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of the study was to develop and validate a deep learning radiomic nomogram (DLRN) for preoperatively assessing breast cancer pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) based on the pre- and post-treatment ultrasound. Methods: Patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) proved by biopsy who proceeded to undergo preoperative NAC were enrolled from hospital #1 (training cohort, 356 cases) and hospital #2 (independent external validation cohort, 236 cases). Deep learning and handcrafted radiomic features reflecting the phenotypes of the pre-treatment (radiomic signature [RS] 1) and post-treatment tumour (RS2) were extracted. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used for feature selection and RS construction. A DLRN was then developed based on the RSs and independent clinicopathological risk factors. The performance of the model was assessed with regard to calibration, discrimination and clinical usefulness. Results: The DLRN predicted the pCR status with accuracy, yielded an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.91–0.97) in the validation cohort, with good calibration. The DLRN outperformed the clinical model and single RS within both cohorts (P < 0.05, as per the DeLong test) and performed better than two experts' prediction of pCR (both P < 0.01 for comparison of total accuracy). Besides, prediction within the hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative, HER2+ and triple-negative subgroups also achieved good discrimination performance, with an AUC of 0.90, 0.95 and 0.93, respectively, in the external validation cohort. Decision curve analysis confirmed that the model was clinically useful. Conclusion: A deep learning–based radiomic nomogram had good predictive value for pCR in LABC, which could provide valuable information for individual treatment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: We aimed to develop a predictive model based on pretreatment MRI radiomic features (MRIRF) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels, an established prognostic marker, to improve the accuracy of predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Methods: This Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved retrospective study included a preliminary set of 80 women with biopsy-proven TNBC who underwent NAST, pretreatment dynamic contrast enhanced MRI, and biopsy-based pathologic assessment of TIL. A threshold of ≥ 20% was used to define high TIL. Patients were classified into pCR and non-pCR based on pathologic evaluation of post-NAST surgical specimens. pCR was defined as the absence of invasive carcinoma in the surgical specimen. Segmentation and MRIRF extraction were done using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved software QuantX. The top five features were combined into a single MRIRF signature value. Results: Of 145 extracted MRIRF, 38 were significantly correlated with pCR. Five nonredundant imaging features were identified: volume, uniformity, peak timepoint variance, homogeneity, and variance. The accuracy of the MRIRF model, P = .001, 72.7% positive predictive value (PPV), 72.0% negative predictive value (NPV), was similar to the TIL model (P = .038, 65.5% PPV, 72.6% NPV). When MRIRF and TIL models were combined, we observed improved prognostic accuracy (P < .001, 90.9% PPV, 81.4% NPV). The models area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.632 (TIL), 0.712 (MRIRF) and 0.752 (TIL + MRIRF). Conclusion: A predictive model combining pretreatment MRI radiomic features with TIL level on pretreatment core biopsy improved accuracy in predicting pCR to NAST in TNBC patients. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study used machine learning classification of texture features from MRI of breast tumor and peri-tumor at multiple treatment time points in conjunction with molecular subtypes to predict eventual pathological complete response (PCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Materials and method: This study employed a subset of patients (N = 166) with PCR data from the I-SPY-1 TRIAL (2002–2006). This cohort consisted of patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer that underwent anthracycline–cyclophosphamide and taxane treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, early, and mid-treatment. Texture features were extracted from post-contrast-enhanced MRI, pre- and post-contrast subtraction images, and with morphological dilation to include peri-tumoral tissue. Molecular subtypes and Ki67 were also included in the prediction model. Performance of classification models used the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis including area under the curve (AUC). Statistical analysis was done using unpaired two-tailed t-tests. Results: Molecular subtypes alone yielded moderate prediction performance of PCR (AUC = 0.82, p = 0.07). Pre-, early, and mid-treatment data alone yielded moderate performance (AUC = 0.88, 0.72, and 0.78, p = 0.03, 0.13, 0.44, respectively). The combined pre- and early treatment data markedly improved performance (AUC = 0.96, p = 0.0003). Addition of molecular subtypes improved performance slightly for individual time points but substantially for the combined pre- and early treatment (AUC = 0.98, p = 0.0003). The optimal morphological dilation was 3–5 pixels. Subtraction of post- and pre-contrast MRI further improved performance (AUC = 0.98, p = 0.00003). Finally, among the machine-learning algorithms evaluated, the RUSBoosted Tree machine-learning method yielded the highest performance. Conclusion: AI-classification of texture features from MRI of breast tumor at multiple treatment time points accurately predicts eventual PCR. Longitudinal changes in texture features and peri-tumoral features further improve PCR prediction performance. Accurate assessment of treatment efficacy early on could minimize unnecessary toxic chemotherapy and enable mid-treatment modification for patients to achieve better clinical outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: There are limited data on pretreatment imaging features that can predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). To extract volumetric pretreatment MRI radiomics features and assess corresponding associations with breast cancer molecular subtypes, pathological complete response (pCR), and residual cancer burden (RCB) in patients treated with NAC. Materials and Methods: In this IRB-approved study, clinical and pretreatment MRI data from patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer who received NAC between September 2009 and July 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Tumors were manually identified and semi-automatically segmented on first postcontrast images. Morphological and three-dimensional textural features were computed, including unfiltered and filtered image data, with spatial scaling factors (SSF) of 2, 4, and 6 mm. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were used for statistical analysis. Results: Two hundred and fifty nine patients with unilateral breast cancer, including 73 (28.2%) HER2+, 112 (43.2%) luminal, and 74 (28.6%) triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), were included. There was a significant difference in the median volume (p = 0.008), median longest axial tumor diameter (p = 0.009), and median longest volumetric diameter (p = 0.01) among tumor subtypes. There was also a significant difference in minimum signal intensity and entropy among the tumor subtypes with SSF = 4 mm (p = 0.009 and p = 0.02 respectively) and SSF = 6 mm (p = 0.007 and p < 0.001 respectively). Additionally, sphericity (p = 0.04) in HER2+ tumors and entropy with SSF = 2, 4, 6 mm (p = 0.004, 0.02, 0.047 respectively) in luminal tumors were significantly associated with pCR. Multiple features demonstrated significant association (p < 0.05) with pCR in TNBC and with RCB in luminal tumors and TNBC, with standard deviation of intensity with SSF = 6 mm achieving the highest AUC (AUC = 0.734) for pCR in TNBC. Conclusion: MRI radiomics features are associated with different molecular subtypes of breast cancer, pCR, and RCB. These features may be noninvasive imaging biomarkers to identify cancer subtype and predict response to NAC. © 2020 The Association of University Radiologists},

	abstract = {Purpose: Neoadjuvant pharmacotherapy is essential for patients with breast cancer who wish to preserve the breast by shrinking the malignant tumor, allowing breast-conserving surgery. It may eliminate cancer cells completely, which is known as pathologic complete response (pCR). Patients with pCR have a lower risk of recurrence. The purpose of this study was to develop a method for predicting patients who achieve pCR by neoadjuvant pharmacotherapy using radiomic features in MR images. Methods: Fat-suppressed T2-weighted MR images of 64 cases were identified from the ISPY1 dataset. There were 26 cases of pCR and 38 cases of non-pCR. The image slice with the largest tumor diameter was selected from MR images, and the tumor region was manually segmented. A total of 371 radiomic features were calculated from the tumor region. We selected nine radiomic features using Lasso in this study. A support vector machine (SVM) with nine radiomic features was used for predicting patients with pCR. Results: The result of the ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve of SVM was 0.92 for distinguishing between pCR and non-pCR. Although the input data contain data that were misclassified by SVM, the survival curve classified into the pCR group was at a higher position than the non-pCR group. However, the log-rank test was p= 0.2. Conclusions: We developed a method to predict patients with pCR by neoadjuvant pharmacotherapy using noninvasive MR images. The survival curve of patients classified as having pCR by the proposed method was higher than those classified as non-pCR. Since the proposed method predicts patients who achieve pCR by neoadjuvant pharmacotherapy, it enhances the value of preoperative image information. © 2022, CARS.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous studies have suggested that texture analysis is a promising tool in the diagnosis, characterization, and assessment of treatment response in various cancer types. Therefore, application of texture analysis may be helpful for early prediction of pathologic response in breast cancer. Purpose: To investigate whether texture analysis of features from MRI is associated with pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 136 women (mean age, 47.9 years; range, 31-70 years) who underwent NAC and subsequent surgery for breast cancer between January 2012 and August 2017. Patients were monitored with 3.0-T MRI before (pretreatment) and after (midtreatment) three or four cycles of NAC. Texture analysis was performed at pre- and midtreatment T2-weighted MRI, contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping by using commercial software. A random forest method was applied to build a predictive model for classifying those with pCR with use of texture parameters. Diagnostic performance for predicting pCR was assessed and compared with that of six other machine learning classifiers (adaptive boosting, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, linear support vector machine, naive Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis) by using the Wald test and DeLong method. Results: Forty of the 136 patients (29%) achieved pCR after NAC. In the prediction of pCR, the random forest classifier showed the lowest diagnostic performance with pretreatment ADC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.44, 0.61) and the highest diagnostic performance with midtreatment contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (AUC, 0.82; 95% confidence interval: 0.74, 0.88) among pre- and midtreatment T2-weighted MRI, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, and ADC mapping. Conclusion: Texture parameters using a random forest method of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI at midtreatment of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were valuable and associated with pathologic complete response in breast cancer. © RSNA, 2019},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning (ML) based model to accurately predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using pretreatment clinical and pathological characteristics of electronic medical record (EMR) data in breast cancer (BC). Methods: The EMR data from patients diagnosed with early and locally advanced BC and who received NAC followed by curative surgery were reviewed. A total of 16 clinical and pathological characteristics was selected to develop ML model. We practiced six ML models using default settings for multivariate analysis with extracted variables. Results: In total, 2065 patients were included in this analysis. Overall, 30.6% (n = 632) of patients achieved pCR. Among six ML models, the LightGBM had the highest area under the curve (AUC) for pCR prediction. After hyper-parameter tuning with Bayesian optimization, AUC was 0.810. Performance of pCR prediction models in different histology-based subtypes was compared. The AUC was highest in HR+HER2- subgroup and lowest in HR−/HER2- subgroup (HR+/HER2- 0.841, HR+/HER2+ 0.716, HR−/HER2 0.753, HR−/HER2- 0.653). Conclusions: A ML based pCR prediction model using pre-treatment clinical and pathological characteristics provided useful information to predict pCR during NAC. This prediction model would help to determine treatment strategy in patients with BC planned NAC. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of the study was to develop a deep learning (DL) algorithm to evaluate the pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Methods: A total of 302 breast cancer patients in this retrospective study were randomly divided into a training set (n = 244) and a validation set (n = 58). Tumor regions were manually delineated on each slice by two expert radiologists on enhanced T1-weighted images. Pathological results were used as ground truth. Deep learning network contained five repetitions of convolution and max-pooling layers and ended with three dense layers. The pre-NAC model and post-NAC model inputted six phases of pre-NAC and post-NAC images, respectively. The combined model used 12 channels from six phases of pre-NAC and six phases of post-NAC images. All models above included three indexes of molecular type as one additional input channel. Results: The training set contained 137 non-pCR and 107 pCR participants. The validation set contained 33 non-pCR and 25 pCR participants. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of three models was 0.553 for pre-NAC, 0.968 for post-NAC and 0.970 for the combined data, respectively. A significant difference was found in AUC between using pre-NAC data alone and combined data (P < 0.001). The positive predictive value of the combined model was greater than that of the post-NAC model (100% vs. 82.8%, P = 0.033). Conclusion: This study established a deep learning model to predict PCR status after neoadjuvant therapy by combining pre-NAC and post-NAC MRI data. The model performed better than using pre-NAC data only, and also performed better than using post-NAC data only. Key points: Significant findings of the study. It achieved an AUC of 0.968 for pCR prediction. It showed a significantly greater AUC than using pre-NAC data only. What this study adds.

	abstract = {Objectives: In this proof of concept study, a deep learning–based method for automatic analysis of digital mammograms (DM) as a tool to aid in assessment of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) treatment response in breast cancer (BC) was examined. Methods: Baseline DM from 453 patients receiving NACT between 2005 and 2019 were included in the study cohort. A deep learning system, using the aforementioned baseline DM, was developed to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in the surgical specimen after completion of NACT. Two image patches, one extracted around the detected tumour and the other from the corresponding position in the reference image, were fed into a classification network. For training and validation, 1485 images obtained from 400 patients were used, and the model was ultimately applied to a test set consisting of 53 patients. Results: A total of 95 patients (21%) achieved pCR. The median patient age was 52.5 years (interquartile range 43.7–62.1), and 255 (56%) were premenopausal. The artificial intelligence (AI) model predicted the pCR as represented by the area under the curve of 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.53–0.90; p = 0.035). The sensitivity was 46% at a fixed specificity of 90%. Conclusions: Our study describes an AI platform using baseline DM to predict BC patients’ responses to NACT. The initial AI performance indicated the potential to aid in clinical decision-making. In order to continue exploring the clinical utility of AI in predicting responses to NACT for BC, further research, including refining the methodology and a larger sample size, is warranted. Key Points: • We aimed to answer the following question: Prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, can artificial intelligence (AI) applied to digital mammograms (DM) predict breast tumour response? • DMs contain information that AI can make use of for predicting pathological complete (pCR) response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. • By developing an AI system designed to focus on relevant parts of the DM, fully automatic pCR prediction can be done well enough to potentially aid in clinical decision-making. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As visual quantification of the density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) lacks in precision, digital image analysis (DIA) approach has been applied in order to improve. In several studies, TIL density has been examined on hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections using DIA. The aim of the present study was to quantify TIL density on HE sections of core needle biopsies using DIA and investigate its association with clinicopathological parameters and pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. The study cohort comprised of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, all treated with neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy. DIA software applying machine learning-based classification of epithelial and stromal elements was used to count TILs. TIL density was determined as the number of TILs per square millimeter of stromal tissue. Median TIL density was 1287/mm2 (range, 123–8101/mm2). A high TIL density was associated with higher histological grade (P = 0.02), estrogen receptor negativity (P = 0.036), and pathological complete response (pCR) (P < 0.0001). In analyses using receiver operating characteristic curves, a threshold TIL density of 2420/mm2 best discriminated pCR from non-pCR. In multivariate analysis, high TIL density (> 2420/mm2) was significantly associated with pCR (P < 0.0001). Our results indicate that DIA can assess TIL density quantitatively, machine learning-based classification algorithm allowing determination of TIL density as the number of TILs per unit area, and TIL density established by this method appears to be an independent predictor of pCR in HER2-positive breast cancer. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},
